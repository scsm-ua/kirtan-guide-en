# Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

## Song 6

    nayanaṁ galad-aśru-dhārayā
    vadanaṁ gadgada-ruddhayā girā
    pulakair nichitaṁ vapuḥ kadā
    tava nāma-grahaṇe bhaviṣyati

“Oh Lord, when will tears flow from my eyes like waves, And my voice tremble in ecstasy? When will the hairs of my body stand on end while chanting Your Holy Name?”

#### 1

    aparādha-phole mama    chitta bhela vajra sama
        tuyā nāme nā lobhe bikāra
    hatāś hoiya hari    tava nāma ucha kori
        boḍo duḥkhe ḍāki bāro bāro

Oh Lord Hari, asa result of my offences incurred in previous lifetimes, my heart has become as hard as a thunderbolt, and feels no change upon chanting Your Holy Name. Disappointed, hopeless, and in great distress, I loudly call Your Name again and again.

#### 2

    dīna dayāmoy karuṇā-nidān
    bhāva-bindu dei rākhoho parāṇ

Oh Lord, you are compassionate towards the fallen souls and the origin of mercy. Please give me a drop of divine ecstasy and thereby save my life!

#### 3

    kobe tuyā nāma-uchāraṇe mor
    nayane jharabo daro daro lor

When will an incessant stream of tears flow from my eyes as I chant Your Name in divine ecstasy?

#### 4

    gada-gada-svara kaṇṭhe upajabo
    mukhe bolo ādha ādha bāhirābo

When will my voice be choked with divine emotion, and when will words garbled due to ecstasy come from my mouth?

#### 5

    pulake bharabo śorīra hāmāra
    sveda-kampa-stambha hobe bāro bāro

When will the hairs of my body stand up in ecstasy? When will I become stunned with ecstasy, shiver and perspire out of the ecstasy of divine love? When will these symptoms of ecstasy overwhelm me again and again?

#### 6

    bibarṇa-śorīre hārāobu̐ jñāna
    nāma-samāśraye dharobu parāṇa

When will my body turn colours and become pale out of ecstasy? When will I lose consciousness? And when will my very life be under the shelter of the Holy Name?

#### 7

    milabo hāmār kiye aiche dina
    roye bhakativinoda mati hīna

Bhakti Vinod, who is devoid of good intelligence cries, “When will I meet with such a day?”
