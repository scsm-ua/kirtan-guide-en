In the Holy Abode of transcendental touchstone,
Śrī Nabadwīp Dham—the selfsame Śrī Vṛndāvan, in the land of Koladwīp, whose inner identity
is the King of mountains Śrī Govardhan,
near the charming shores of the holy River Bhāgīrathī who delivers all the fallen souls,
stands that grand and glorious King of all Temples— Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh.

In that beautiful retreat, the surrendered devotees whose lives are the message of Śrī Gaura,
are eternally absorbed in the loving service
of the Divine Master, the Golden Lord Gaurāṅga, and the Loving Lord Śrī Govindasundar
with His consort Śrīmatī Gāndharvā, accompanied by all Their beloved associates.

With hearts always filled with good hope
to attain the grace of the Lord, following faithfully in the line
of Śrī Śrī Rūpa and Raghunāth— the storekeepers of the unlimited treasure
of pure, sweet love divine—
those surrendered souls ever sing the unending glories of the transcendental name and qualities
of the most magnanimous, original Supreme Lord, Śrī Śrī Gaurāṅgasundar.

Indeed the hearts of all beings, moving and still,
marvel in the glory of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh as they take shelter in the soothing, affectionate shade
of the victory flag that flies aloft
and sings wholeheartedly to the world the ever-expanding renown of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh;
bearing that banner of all transcendental benedictions,
Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh ever shines resplendent in all its divine magnificence.
Nabadwīp,
Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh
