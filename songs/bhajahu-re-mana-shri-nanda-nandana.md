# Bhajahu̐ Re Mana

### by Śrīla Govinda dās Kavirāj

#### 1

    bhajahu̐ re mana    śrī-nanda-nandana
        abhaya-charaṇāravinda re
    dūrlabha mānava    janama sat-saṅge
        taroho e bhava-sindhu re

O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the son of Nanda, which make one fearless. Having obtained this rare human birth, cross over this ocean of worldly existence through the association of saintly persons.

#### 2

    śīta ātapa    bāta bariṣaṇa
        e dina jāminī jāgi re
    biphale sevinu    kṛpaṇa durajana
        chapala sukha-laba lāgi’ re

Both in the day and at night I remain sleepless, suffering the pains of the heat and cold, the wind and the rain. For a fraction of flickering happiness I have uselessly served wicked and miserly men.

#### 3

    e dhana, jauvana,    putra, parijana
        ithe ki āche paratīti re
    kamala-dala-jala,    jīvana ṭalamala
        bhajahu̐ hari-pada niti re

What assurance of real happiness is there in all of one’s wealth, youthfulness, sons, and family members? This life is tottering like a drop of water on a lotus petal; therefore you should always serve and worship the divine feet of Lord Hari.

#### 4

    śravaṇa, kīrtana,    smaraṇa, vandana,
        pāda-sevana, dāsya re
    pūjana, sakhī-jana,    ātma-nivedana
        govinda-dāsa-abhilāṣa re

It is the desire and great longing of Govinda dās to engage himself in the nine processes of bhakti, namely hearing the glories of Lord Hari and chanting those glories, constantly remembering Him and offering prayers to Him, serving the Lord’s lotus feet, serving the Supreme Lord as a servant, worshipping Him with flowers and incense and so forth, serving Him as a friend, and completely offering the Lord one’s very self.
