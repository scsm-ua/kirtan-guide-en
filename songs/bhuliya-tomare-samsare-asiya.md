# Dainya - bhuliyā tomāre

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    bhuliyā tomāre,    saṁsāre āsiyā,
        peye nānābidha byathā
    tomāra charaṇe    āsiyāchi āmi,
        bolibo duḥkhera kathā

O Lord, forgetting you and coming to this material world, I have experienced various pains and sorrows. Now I am approaching your lotus feet to submit my tale of woe.

    jananī-joṭhore,    chilāma jokhon,
        viṣama vandhana-pāśe
    ekabāra prabhu!    dekhā diyā more,
        vañchile e dīna dāse

While I was bound up tightly in the unbearable confines of my mother’s womb, O Lord, You once revealed Yourself before me, but briefly, and then abandoned this poor servant of Yours.

    tokhona bhāvinu,    janama pāiyā,
        koribo bhajana tava
    janama hoilo,    poḍi māyājāle
        nā hoilo jñāna-laba

At that moment, I promised that having taken birth I would worship you. But after taking birth, I fell into the entangling network of worldly illusion, devoid of even a drop of true knowledge.

    ādarera chele.    svajanera kole,
        hāsiyā kāṭānu kāla
    janaka-jananī-    snehete bhuliyā
        saṁsara lāgilo bhālo

As a boy fondled in the lap of relatives, I passed my time smiling and laughing. My parents’ affection helped me to forget You still more, my Lord, and I began to think the material world to be a very nice place.

    krame dina dina,    bālaka hoiyā,
        khelinu bālaka saha
    āro kichu dine,    jñāna upajilo,
        pāṭha poḍi aharahaḥ

Day by day I grew and soon began playing with other boys. My powers of understanding emerged and I read and studied my school lessons incessantly.

    idyāra gaurave,    bhrami deśe deśe,
        dhana upārjana kori’
    svajana-pālana,    kori eka mane,
        bhulinu tomāre, hari!

Travelling from place to place, proud of my education, I grew wealthy and maintained my family with undivided attention. O Lord Hari, I forgot You!

#### 7

    vārdhakye ekhona,    bhakativinoda,
        kā̐diyā kātara ati
    nā bhajiyā tore,    dina vṛthā gelo,
        ekhon ki ho’be gati!

Now in old age, this Bhakti Vinod very sadly weeps. I failed to worship You, O Lord, and instead passed my life in vain. What will be my fate now?
