# Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

## Song 2

The second verse of the Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam is as follows:

    nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis
    tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ
    etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavan mamāpi
    durdaivam īdṛśam ihājani nānurāgaḥ

“Oh my Lord, Your Holy Name bestows auspiciousness upon all. And You have unlimited Names such as Krishna and Govinda by which You reveal Yourself. In Your many Holy Names You have kindly invested all Your transcendental potency. And in chanting these Names, there are no strict rules concerning time or place. Out of Your causless mercy, You have descended in the form of divine sound, but my great misfortune is that I have no love for Your Holy Name.”

#### 1

    tuhu̐ dayā-sāgara tārayite prāṇī
    nāma aneka tuyā śikhāoli āni

O Lord! You are an ocean of mercy, and so you have brought the teachings of the glories of your unlimited Holy Names to deliver all souls.

#### 2

    sakala śakati dei nāme tohārā
    grahaṇe rākholi nāhi kāla-vichārā

You have conferred all Your power upon Your Name. And there are no rules governing the appropriate time or place for chanting the Holy Name.

#### 3

    śrī-nāma-chintāmaṇi tohāri samānā
    biśve bilāoli karuṇā-nidānā

The Holy Name is a *chintāmaṇi* gem, a divine touchstone, and is nondifferent from You. Out of Your kindness for all souls, You have distributed Your Holy Name throughout the universe.

#### 4

    tuyā dayā aichana parama udārā
    atiśoya manda nātha! bhāga hāmārā

This is Your mercy, O Lord. You are supremely kind. But, O Lord, I am most wicked and unfortunate.

#### 5

    nāhi janamalo nāme anurāga mora
    bhaktivinoda-chitta duḥkhe bibhora

I have never known any attraction for the Holy Names. And so, the heart of Bhakti Vinod is filled with sadness.
