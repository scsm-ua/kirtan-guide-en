# Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

### Song 7b

#### 1

    gāite ‘govinda’-nām,  upajilo bhāva-grām, dekhilām yamunāra kūle
    vṛṣabhānu-sutā-saṅge, śyāma-naṭa-boro-raṅge, bā̐śarī bājāya nīpo-mūle

And while I sang the name of Govinda a host of ecstasies arose within me. I saw Sundar-śyāma the best of dancers, on Yamunā’s shores, with Śrī Rādhā, Vṛṣabhānu’s daughter, sporting in Pastimes of love playing His flute beside the water while a kadamba tree above cast shade upon the divine couple.

    dekhiyā jugala-dhana,    asthira hoilo mana, jñāna hārā hoilu̐ tokhon
    koto-kṣane nāhi jāni, jñāna-labha hoilo māni, āro nāhi bhelo daraśan

On seeing this, my mind was stunned. I lost my senses. Unaware of time, I fainted. When I awoke after immeasurable time, the treasured couple had gone. My vision of Vraja had broken.
