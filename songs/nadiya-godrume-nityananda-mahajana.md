    nadīyā-godrume nityānanda mahājana
    pātiyāche nāma-haṭṭa jivera kāraṇa

In the land of Nadīyā, on the island of Godruma, the magnanimous Lord Nityānanda has opened up the Marketplace of the Holy Name, meant for the deliverance of all fallen souls.

    (śraddhāvān jon he, śraddhāvān jon he)
    prabhura ājñāya, bhāi, māgi ei bhikṣā
    bolo ‘kṛṣṇa,’ bhajo kṛṣṇa, kara kṛṣṇa-śikṣā

O people of faith! O people of faith! By the order of Lord Gaurāṅga, O brothers, I beg these three requests of you: Chant “Krishna!”, worship Krishna, and teach others about Krishna.

#### 3

    aparādha-śūnya ho’ye loha kṛṣṇa-nāma
    kṛṣṇa mātā, kṛṣṇa pita, kṛṣṇa dhana-prāṇa

Being careful to remain free of offenses, just take the holy name of Lord Krishna. Krishna is your mother, Krishna is your father, and Krishna is the treasure of your life.

#### 4

    kṛṣṇera saṁsāra kara chāḍi’ anāchāra
    jīve dayā, kṛṣṇa-nāma – sarva-dharma-sāra

Giving up all sinful activities, carry on your worldly duties only in relation to Lord Krishna. The showing of compassion to other souls by loudly chanting the holy name of Krishna is the essence of all forms of religion.
