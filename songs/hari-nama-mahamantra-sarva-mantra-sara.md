### The Ten Offences to the Holy Name

#### 1

    hari-nāma mahāmantra sarva-mantra-sāra
    jādera karuṇābale jagate prachāra
    sei nāma-parāyaṇ sādhu, mahājana
    tāhādera nindā nā koriho kadāchana

Hare Krishna Mahāmantra— of all mantras the best,\
Throughout the world is preached by saints’ potent grace behest;\
Such saints to the Name devoted, such pure souls great:\
Never dare offend them— never show them hate.

#### 2

    vrajendranandana kṛṣṇa sarveśvareśvara
    maheśvara ādi tāra sevana-tatpara
    nāma chintāmaṇi kṛṣṇa-chaitanya-svarūpa
    bheda-jñāna nā koribe līlā-guṇa-rūpa

Lord Krishna, son of Nanda, of all lords the Leader —\
The great Shiva and all the gods serve His feet forever;\
The touchstone of the Name is Krishna incarnate—\
His Pastimes, nature, form, also think not separate.

#### 3

    ‘‘guru kṛṣṇa-rūpa hon śāstrera pramāṇe
    guru-rūpe kṛṣṇa kṛpā kore bhāgyavāne’’
    se gurute martya-buddhi avajñādi tyaji
    iṣṭa-lābha kara, nirantara nāma bhaji

“Guru’s a form of Krishna — the Scriptures corroborate;\
In the form of Guru, Krishna blesses the fortunate.”\
Never offend that Guru by thinking him mere mortal;\
Gain your highest objective — serve the Name for time eternal.

#### 4

    śruti, śruti-mātā-saha sātvata-purāṇa
    śrī-nāma-charaṇa-padma kore nīrājana
    sei śruti śāstra jebā karaye nindana
    se aparadhīra saṅga koribe varjana

The Vedas with Mother Gāyatrī and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam\
Illuminate the lotus feet of Śrī Hari’s Name;\
Whoever vilifies those Holy Vedic Scriptures —\
Never keep their company, know them as offenders.

#### 5

    nāmera mahimā sarva-śāstrete vākhāne
    atistuti, heno kabhu nā bhāviha mane
    agastya, ananta, brahmā, śivādi satata
    je nāma-mahimā-gāthā saṅkīrtana-rata
    se nāma-mahimā-sindhu ke pāibe pāra
    atistuti bole jei—sei durāchāra

The glories of the Name— all Scriptures’ exaltation;\
Dare not think their praise to be exaggeration.\
Agastya, Ananta, Brahmā, Shiva, etc., ever\
Sing the glories of that Name with full-hearted fervour.\
Who can cross the ocean of the glories of that Name?\
Whoever says ‘exaggeration’ have their sin to blame.

#### 6

    kṛṣṇa-nāmāboli nitya golokera dhana
    kalpita, prākṛta, bhāve—aparādhi-jana

The Holy Names of Krishna—eternal wealth of Goloka:\
Who thinks those Names imaginary, mundane—he’s offender.

#### 7

    nāme sarva-pāpa-kṣaya sarva-śāstre kaya
    sārā-dina pāpa kori sei bharasāya—
    emata durbuddhi jāra sei aparādhi
    māyā-pravañchita, duḥkha bhuñje niravadhi

All Scriptures claim the Name all sin it can destroy,\
But those who spend their time in sin making it a ploy —\
Such a wicked attitude is that of an offender\
Deceived by illusion, perpetually to suffer.

#### 8

    atulya śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāma pūrṇa-rasa-nidhi
    tāra sama nā bhāviha śubha-karma ādi

Incomparable Name of Krishna—the treasure of ecstasy:\
Never dare compare it with auspicious piety.

#### 9

    nāme śraddhā-hina-jana—vidhātā vāñchita
    tāre nāma dāne aparādha suniśchita

Those who’re faithless t’ward the Name — deceived by Providence: \
Giving them the Holy Name surely’s an offence.

#### 10

    śuniyāo kṛṣṇa-nāma-māhātmya apāra
    je priti-rahita, sei narādhama chāra
    allaṅtā mamatā jāra antare bāhire
    śuddha kṛṣṇa-nāma tāra kabhu nāhi sphure

Despite them hearing the infinite glories of Krishna’s Name,\
Those whose hearts don’t melt in love are rascals of ill fame;\
Only pride and avarice their thoughts and deeds do yield —\
The Pure Name of Krishna to them is ne’er revealed.

#### 11

    ei daśa aparādha koriyā varjana
    jena jana kore harināma saṅkīrtana
    apūrva śrī-kṛṣṇa-prema labhya tāre hoy
    nāma-prabhu tāra hṛde nitya vilasay

Casting off these ten offences, leaving no exception,\
Those pure souls who chant the Name in Holy Congregation —\
The miracle of love for Krishna they will surely savour,\
The Name Divine Himself will shine within their hearts forever.
