    āmi guru-dāsa—nahi anya

I am a servant of Guru—nothing else.

#### 1

    āmi kariba bhramana chaudda-bhuvana
    svarūpe sabāya kari’ udbodhana
    hāte la’ye yāba premera niśāna
    dharāba svarūpa chihna

I will travel throughout the fourteen worlds awakening everyone to their true self. I will go with the banner of divine love in hand and cause everyone to recognise the sign of the true self.

#### 2

    āmi chhāḍāba sakale sarva-dharma
    kariba chūrṇa jñāna o karma
    rachiba viśāla bhakati-harmya
    guru-dāsa nahi anya

I will induce everyone to abandon all religions. I will demolish the pursuits of liberation and worldly enjoyment. I will construct a grand palace of devotion. I am a servant of Guru—nothing else.

#### 3

    āmi bhāṅgiba chhanda lāgāba dhanda
    vāchālera mukha kariba banda
    mṛtyure dhari dāniba śanda
    nāhi kapaṭatā dainya

I will break the customs, bemuse everyone, shut the mouths of the garrulous, hold back death, and distribute good fortune to all. I will do so humbly, without deceit.

#### 4

    sei mahābhāratera mahān parva
    yāhāra prakāśe hayechhe kharva
    dekhāba tā̐hāra asīma garva
    kaitave kari khinna

I will show the unlimited glory of He whose manifestation brought the great portion of the Mahābhārata to an end, and efface all duplicity.

#### 5

    āmi bājāba jagate vijaya-ḍaṅkā
    ghuchāba sakala dvandva-śaṅkā
    bahāba viśve bhakati-gaṅgā
    tuṣi’ hari labhi puṇya

I will sound the kettle-drums of victory throughout the world, dispel all quarrel and fear, and cause the Ganges of pure devotion to flow throughout the universe. Satisfying the Lord in this way, I will attain good fortune.

#### 6

    āmi āryānārya mlechchha sabāya
    lāgāiba ba’le kṛṣṇa-sevāya
    chaḍāiba sabe golokera nā’ya
    pṛthvī kariba śūṇya

I will forcibly engage all—the noble, the ignoble, and the barbarous—in Kṛṣṇa’s service. I will board them all in the boat to Goloka and empty the earth.

#### 7

    āmi chālāba sakale guru-pada bale
    vādāma tuliba hari-bola bale
    mahāmāyā-vinī chhalanā chhalile
    kariba chinna-bhinna

I will guide them all by the power of my Guru’s feet. I will hoist the boat’s sails by the power of chanting ‘Hari’. If Mahāmāyā presents any illusion, I shall cut it asunder.

#### 8

    āmi chinmaya-dhāme chālāiba tarī
    chatur-bhuja habe yata nara-nārī
    sthāvara jaṅgama sabe labhi hari
    habe deva deva mānya

I will drive the boat to the spiritual world, and all the men and women will become four-armed. All moving and inert beings will attain Hari and become worshippable to the demigods.

#### 9

    sabe eka parichaye dibe parichaya
    labhibe svarūpa amṛta-maya
    pūjibe śrī-hari dibe jaya jaya
    nehāri’ ha-iba dhanya

Everyone will identify with the same identity, realise their immortal self, worship Śrī Hari, and call out, ‘Jay! Jay!’ Seeing this, I will be satisfied.

    āmi guru-dāsa nahi anya

I am a servant of Guru—nothing else.
