# Dainya O Prapatti

#### 1

    hari he dayāla mora jaya rādhā-nātha
    bāro bāro ei-bāro loho nija sātha

O Hari! O my merciful Lord! All glories to You, the Lord of Rādhā! Many times I have avoided You, but this time please take me as Your own.

#### 2

    bahu joni bhrami nātha! loinu śaraṇa
    nija-guṇe kṛpā kara adhama tāraṇa

O Lord, after wandering through many wombs, I have taken refuge in You. Be merciful and deliver this wretched soul by Your divine power.

#### 3

    jagata-kāraṇa tumi jagata-jīvana
    tomā chāḍā kāro na’hi he rādhā-ramaṇa

O lover of Rādhā, You are the cause of the universe and the life of the universe. Without You no-one has anything.

#### 4

    bhuvana-maṅgala tumi bhuvanera pati
    tumi upekṣile nātha, ki hoibe gati

You bring about auspiciousness for the world, and You are the master of all the worlds as well. O Lord, what will be my refuge if You neglect me?

#### 5

    bhāviyā dekhinu ei jagata-mājhāre
    tomā vinā keho nāhi e dāse uddhāre

I have considered that in this world there is no one except You who can deliver this fallen servant.
