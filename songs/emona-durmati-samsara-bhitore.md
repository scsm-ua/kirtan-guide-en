    (prabhu he!)
    emona durmati, saṁsāra bhitore,
        poḍiyā āchinu āmi
    tava nija-jana, kono mahājane,
        pāṭhāiyā dile tumi

A wicked mind brought me into this world, O Lord, but one of Your pure and elevated devotees has come to bring me out.

    dayā kori more, patita dekhiyā,
        kohilo āmāre giyā
    ohe dīna-jon, śuno bhālo kathā
        ullasita ho’be hiyā

He saw me so fallen and wretched, took pity, and came to me saying, “O humbled soul, please listen to this good tiding, for it will gladden your heart.”

    tomāre tārite, śrī-kṛṣṇa-chaitanya,
        nabadvīpe avatār
    tomā heno koto, dīna hīna jone,
        korilena bhava-pār

“Śrī Krishna Chaitanya has appeared in the land of Nabadwīp to deliver you. He has safely conducted many miserable souls such as you across the sea of worldly existence.”

    vedera pratijñā,  rākhibāra tore,
        rukma-varṇa vipra-suta
    mahāprabhu nāme, nadīyā mātāya,
        soṅge bhāi avadhūta

“To fulfil the promise of the Vedas, the son of a *brāhmaṇ*, bearing the Name Mahāprabhu of golden complexion, has descended with His brother, the avadhūt Nityānanda. Together They have overwhelmed all of Nadia with divine ecstasy.

    nanda suta jini,  chaitanya gosāi,
        nija-nāma kori’ dāna
    tārilo jagat,  tumi-o jāiyā,
        loho nija-paritrāṇa

“Śrī Chaitanya, who is Krishna Himself, the son of Nanda, has saved the world by freely distributing His own Holy Name. Go also and receive your deliverance.”

#### 6

    se kathā śuniyā,  āsiyāchi, nātha!
        tomāra charaṇa-tole
    bhakativinoda,  kā̐diyā kā̐diyā,
        āpana-kāhinī bole

O Lord, hearing those words, Bhakti Vinod has come weeping to the soles of Your lotus feet and tells the story of his life.
