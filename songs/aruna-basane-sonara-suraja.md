## The Holy Appearance Day of Śrī Gaurasundar

### by Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj

#### 1

    aruṇa basane    sonara sūraja
        udiche keno re āja
    vasanta suṣamā    ujāri āpanā
        ḍhāle keno jagamājha

Why has the Lord appeared suddenly with golden complexion and with golden dress just like the morning sun? Why has He come in the middle of springtime as everything feels so beautiful and wonderful?

#### 2

    taru gulmalatā    apūrva baratā
        bahe keno phole phule
    bhṛṅga o bihaṅge    keno heno raṅge
        saṅgīta taraṅga tule

I cannot understand why, but all the trees, plants and creepers are full of fruits and flowers and they are making song and dance with Mahāprabhu.

#### 3

    patita durjana    keno re garjana
        ullāse phāṭhiyā poḍe
    vidyā kula dhana    abhimānī jana
        keno mlāna duḥkha bhore

I am very fallen and unqualified. Why is this sound vibration coming to me, and why am I getting inspiration through it. Those who have high caste, vast knowledge and material wealth, they have so much ego and pride. Why are they suffering?

#### 4

    ākāśa bātāsa    ghuchāiya trāsa
        āśvāse bhāsāye dey
    sādhu-jana mana    sukha vitaraṇa
        āveśe unmāda hoy

The sky and the air are so beautiful in the spring season, and they are naturally nourishing and inspiring everybody. In the same way the sound vibration of the devotees spreads everywhere automatically as they distribute Krishna’s Name.

#### 5

    chaudikete dhvani    ki apūrva śuni
        bahujana ucharola
    hare kṛṣṇa rāma    nāma divya-dhāma
        hari hari hari bolo

What a remarkable sound is heard in all directions bringing jubilation to all the people. The devotees chant the divine Names “Hare, Krishna, Rāma,” and the transcendental abode manifests. Chant Hari Hari Hari!

#### 6

    phālgunī pūrṇimā    hindola raṅgimā
        sujana-bhajana rāge
    saṅkīrtana sane    marama gahane
        nā jāni kibhāva jāge

On His holy appearance day, the festival of Holly takes place. All the devotees are chanting as well as all the Hindus. No-one can understand the feeling and the substance that comes within the heart from that saṅkīrtan.

#### 7

    sandhyā samāgama    tapana magana
        keno hema ghana kole
    aparūpa kata    pūraba parvata
        suvarṇa chandramā bhāle

As the sunset approaches, the sun shines on the mountain illuminating it like it has golden ornaments. This is especially so in the springtime. Then as the moon rises it also beautifies that mountain with its rays.

#### 8

    suvarṇa chandramā    paśiche nīlimā
        se nīla bilīna heme
    ithe kiba bhāya    sādhu-jana gāya
        kalaṅka nā rahe preme

The blue sky is covered by the Golden Moon and when the devotees glorify the Lord with their discussions, no other conception or motive can exist other than Krishna consciousness. At that time, *prema*, divine love descends automatically without any impediment.

#### 9

    mahājane bole    grahaṇera chole
        saṅge nāma saṅkīrtana
    gaurachandrodaya    pāpa rāhu kṣaya
        chandraśobhā prema dhana

The great devotees say, take up your spiritual path with the congregational chanting of the Lord’s Holy Names. With the appearance of Śrī Gaurachandra, all sinfulness is removed and everyone attains the treasure of love of Godhead.

#### 10

    marmajña sakale    keho kutūhale
        nīlimā bilīna chā̐de
    channa avatāra    lukāna kāhāra
        rādhā-ruchi-rūpa-chā̐de

Everyone who engages in this nāma saṅkīrtan of Mahāprabhu, comes to enquire sincerely and to know the innermost secret of the Lord’s bluish colour absorbed by his golden features. This is the hidden incarnation of the Lord and the concealed feature of His form is that he is tasting the threefold relish of Śrī Rādhā.

#### 11

    ithe heno stuti    rādhā-bhāva dyuti
        suvalita śyāmarāo
    udilo gaurāṅga    nāma-prema saṅga
        jaya jaya gorā gāo

Thus I pray to the dark cowherd Śyāmasundar who has taken the mood and effulgence of Śrī Rādhā. That Lord, Śrī Chaitanya appeared with the chanting of the pure divine name; everyone chant the glories of that Golden Lord, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.
