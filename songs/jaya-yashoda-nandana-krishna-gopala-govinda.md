    jaya yaśodā-nandana kṛṣṇa gopāla govinda
    jaya madana-mohana hari ananta mukunda

All glories to Krishna, the son of Mother Yaśodā, the cowherd boy and giver of pleasure to the cows! All glories to the conquerer of Cupid, Lord Hari, who takes away all inauspiciousness, who is unlimited, and the awarder of liberation!

    jaya achyuta mādhava rām vṛndāvana-chandra
    jaya muralī-vadana śyāma gopī-janānanda

All glories to the infallible Lord, husband of the goddess of fortune, the supreme enjoyer, and the moon of Vṛndāvan! All glories to Krishna, who always holds a flute to His mouth, who is the colour of a dark blue raincloud, and is the bliss of the gopīs!
