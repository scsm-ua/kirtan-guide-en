# Goptṛtve Varaṇa

## by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ki jāni ki bale,   tomāra dhāmete, hoinu śaraṇāgata
    tumi dayāmoy,   patita-pāvana, patita-tāraṇe rata

By what personal knowledge or strength has one such as I come to Your shelter? Surely it is by Your mercy alone, for You are ever seeking the purification and deliverance of the fallen souls.

#### 2

    bharasā āmāra,   ei mātra nāth! tumi to’ karuṇāmoya
    tava dayā pātra,   nāhi mora sama, avaśya ghuchāre bhaya

You are my only hope, for You are full of compassion and mercy. There is no one who needs Your mercy more than I. You will surely drive away all fear.

#### 3

    āmāre tārite,    kāhāro śakati, avanī-bhitore nāhi
    dayāla ṭhākura!    ghoṣaṇā tomāra, adhama pāmare trāhi

No one else has the power to deliver me. O merciful Lord, by Your declaration, kindly deliver this vile and lowly sinner.

#### 4

    sakala chāḍiyā,   āsiyāchi āmi, tomāra charaṇe nātha!
    āmi nitya-dāsa,     tumi pālayitā, tumi goptā, jagannātha!

I have given up everything and come to Your lotus feet. I am Your eternal servant, and You are my protector and maintainer, O Lord of the universe.

#### 5

    tomāra sakala,  āmi mātra dāsa, āmāra tāribe tumi
    tomāra charaṇa, korinu varaṇa, āmāra nahi to’ āmi

Everything is Yours. I am merely a servant, certain that You will deliver me. I have chosen Your lotus feet as my only shelter. I no longer belong to myself.

#### 6

    bhakativinoda,  kā̐diya śaraṇa, lo’yeche tomāra pāya
    khomi aparādha,  nāme ruchi diyā, pālana karahe tāya

Weeping, Bhakti Vinod takes shelter at Your feet. Forgive his offences, afford him a taste for the Holy Name, and kindly maintain him.
