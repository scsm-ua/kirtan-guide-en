## Composed by Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj

#### 1

    mahā-bhaya śaṅkula  e bhava taraṅginī janama-maraṇa mālā-dale
    niśi-diśi gatāgati     kara ta̐hi jīva-kula mohita mahāmāyā bale

Filled with tremendous trepidation ( *mahā-bhaya* ), the *jīva* -souls are carried away by the waves of the ocean of material existence along the chain of birth and death, perpetually coming and going in all directions through- out the darkness of the confines of the illusory environ- ment, captivated by the power of Mahāmāyā.

#### 2

    karabi ki mana abhāgiyā—
    bhuvana-mohana-māyā kemane re utarabi labhibi kemane kānāiyā?

O Mind! What can you do about my great misfor- tune? Mahāmāyā bewilders the whole universe, how will you ever overcome her? How will you attain Kānāi-lāl— the youthful Krishna of Goloka Vṛndāvan?

#### 3

    nija-rūpevitāri’  tri-guṇa-jāle phā̐da rachi’ ta̐̐hi māhe gaṇikā pratiṣṭhā—
    kanaka varāṅganā    dāniyā āmiṣa sama sa̐pitechhe kāla-kare dhṛṣṭā

In your own form you are trying to cross over the net of the three modes of material nature but in doing so they have bound you in a noose. You have treated Māyā like a prostitute. She has been feeding you *kanak* , *kāminī* , and *pratiṣṭha* just like meat and you have become immersed in the darkness of arrogance.

#### 4

    mana majhu vāta avadhāna
    soi dayālu prabhu charaṇa saroje mana dhana-tanu, sabahu̐ dāna

O my mind, your attention is like the wind. Your real wealth will be found at the lotus feet of the all-mer- ciful Lord, so give yourself completely there.

#### 5

    yā̐kara māyā    tachhu pade paraṇami leha śaraṇa hoi dīna
    svapaneha nā bhāviha  tā̐ka charaṇa vinu dharama yukati samīchīna

Offer yourself to the lotus feet of the Lord who is the owner and controller of Māyā, taking shelter there in all humility. Do not even dream that without His lo- tus feet you can properly adjust with the environment or practice spiritual life ( *dhārma* ).
