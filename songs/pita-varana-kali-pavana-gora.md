### Song 1

    cheto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ
    bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ śreyaḥ-kairava-chandrikā-
    vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhu-jīvanaṁ ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ
    prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ sarvātma-snapanaṁ paraṁ
    vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam

The Holy Name of Krishna cleanses the mirror of the heart and extinguishes the fire of misery in the forest of birth and death. As the evening lotus blooms in the moon’s cooling rays, the heart begins to blossom in the nectar of the Name.
And at last the soul awakens to its real inner treasure—a life of love with Krishna. Again and again tasting nectar, the soul dives and surfaces in the ever-increasing ocean of ecstatic joy.
All phases of the self of which we may conceive are fully satisfied and purified, and at last conquered by the all-auspicious influence of the Holy Name of Krishna.
