# Vaiṣṇava Ke?— “Who is a Real Vaiṣṇava?”

## by Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur

#### 1

    duṣṭa mana!  tumi kisera vaiṣṇava? pratiṣṭhāra tore,     nirjanera ghore,
    tava ‘harināma’ kevala ‘kaitava’

Oh wicked mind! What kind of Vaiṣṇava do you think you are? Your pretentious show of chanting Lord Hari’s Holy Name in a solitary place is only for the sake of attaining the false prestige of a worldly reputation—it is nothing but pure hypocrisy.

#### 2

    jaḍera pratiṣṭhā, śūkarer biṣṭhā, jāno nā ki tāhā māyār vaibhava
    kanaka kāminī,     divasa-jāminī, bhāviyā ki kāja, anitya se saba

Such materialistic prestige is as disgusting as the stool of a hog. Do you not know that it is only a mere illusion cast by the potency of Māyā? What is the val- ue of contemplating day and night your plans for en- joying wealth and women? All these things are only temporary.

#### 3

    tomāra kanaka,      bhogera janaka, kanakera dvāre sevaho mādhava
    kāminīr kāma,      nahe tava dhāma, tāhār—mālika kevala jādava

When you claim wealth as your own, it creates in you ever-increasing desires for material enjoyment. Your riches should be used for serving Mādhava, the Lord of all wealth. Neither is it your proper place to indulge in lust for women, whose only true proprietor is Lord Jādava.

#### 4

    pratiṣṭhāśā-taru, jaḍa-māyā-maru, nā pela rāvaṇa jujhiyā rāghava
    vaiṣṇavī pratiṣṭhā,    tāte kara niṣṭhā, tāhā nā bhajile labhibe raurava

The demon Rāvaṇa (lust-incarnate) fought with
Lord Rāmachandra (love-incarnate) in order to gain the tree of worldly reputation—but that oasis
turned out to be but a mirage cast in the desert wasteland of the Lord’s illusory material potency. Please cultivate fixed determination to attain only the steady and solid platform whereupon a Vaiṣṇava ever stands. If you ne- glect worshiping the Lord from this position, then you will ultimately attain a hellish existence.

#### 5

    harijana-dveṣa,      pratisthāśā-kleśa, kara keno tobe tāhāra gaurava
    vaiṣṇaver pāche, pratisthāśā āche, tā’te kabhu nahe anitya-vaibhava

Why do you needlessly suffer the torment of blaspheming the devotees of Lord Hari, attempting to achieve their eminence, thereby only proving your own fruitless foolishness? The desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilled when one becomes a devotee of the Lord, for eternal fame automatically follows the heels of a Vaiṣṇava. And that fame is never to be considered a temporary worldly opulence.

#### 6

    se hari-sambandha,   śūnya-māyā-gandha, tāhā kobhu noy jaḍer kaitava
    pratiṣṭhā-chaṇḍālī,   nirjanatā-jāli, ubhaye jāniho māyika raurava

The relationship between a devotee and Lord Hari is devoid of even a trace of worldly illusion; it has nothing to do with the materialistic cheating propensity. The prestige of so-called popularity in the material realm is compared to a treacherous dog-eating witch, and the attempt to live in solitude to supposedly engage in un- alloyed bhajan is compared to an entangling network of distraction. Please know that anyone striving in either of these ways verily lives in the hell of Māyā’s illusion.

#### 7

    kīrtana chāḍibo, pratiṣṭhā māgibo, ki kāja ḍhuḍiyā tādṛśa gaurava
    mādhavendra purī,    bhāva-ghore churi, nā korilo kobhu sadāi jānabo

“I shall give up chanting the Lord’s Name publicly
174  in kīrtan and retire to solitude, thus smearing my- self with worldly honour.” Dear mind, what is the
good of seeking such so-called glory? I will always re- mind you that the great soul Mādhavendra Purī never deceived himself in that regard by committing theft in his own storehouse of perception the way you do.

#### 8

    tomāra pratiṣṭhā,—   śūkarera biṣṭhā, tār-saha sama kabhu nā mānava
    matsaratā-vaśe,     tumi jaḍa-rase, ma’jecho chāḍiyā kīrtana-sauṣṭava

Your cheap reputation is equal to the stool of a hog. An ordinary ambitious man like you can never be equat- ed with a devotee of Mādhavendra Purī’s eminence. Un- der the sway of envy, you have drowned yourself in the filthy waters of material enjoyment after having aban- doned the excellent perfection of congregational kīrtan.

#### 9

    tāi duṣṭa mana,  nirjana bhajan, prachāricho chole kuyogī-vaibhava
    prabhu sanātane,       parama jatane, śikṣā dilo jāhā, chinto sei saba

Truly, Oh wicked mind, the glories of so-called sol- itary worship are propagated only by false yogīs using unscrupulous means to deceive others. To save yourself from these pitfalls, please contemplate the instructions that the Supreme Lord Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu kind- ly gave us while addressing Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī with the utmost care.

#### 10

    sei duṭi kathā,     bhulo’ nā sarvathā, uchaiḥ-svare kara hari-nāma-rava
    phalgu āro jukta,     baddha āro mukta, kabhu nā bhāviho, ‘ekākār’ saba

Do not forget for a moment the two most valuable concepts that He taught: 1) the principle of dry, apparent renunciation as opposed to real, appropriate renuncia- tion; and 2) the principle of a soul being trapped in the bondage of matter as opposed to a soul who is liberated. Don’t ever make the mistake of thinking that these con- flicting concepts are on the same level. Please remember
this while engaging yourself in chanting the Lord ’s Holy Names as loud as you possibly can.

#### 11

    kanaka-kāminī,     pratiṣṭhā-bāghinī, chāḍiyāche jāre, sei to’ vaiṣṇava
    sei anāsakta,       sei śuddha-bhakta, saṁsāra tathā pāy parābhava

One is truly a Vaiṣṇava who has given up the habit of falling victim to the ferocious tigress of wealth, beauty, and fame. Such a soul is factually detached from material life, and is known as a pure devotee. Someone with this consciousness of detachment has thereby become victo- rious over the mundane world of birth and death.

#### 12

    yathā-jogya bhoga,    nāhi tathā roga, anāsakta sei, ki āro kahabo
    āsakti-rohita,      sambandha-sohito, viṣoya-samūha sakali mādhava

One is indeed detached who moderately partakes of worldly things that are deemed necessary for living in devotional service; a devotee acting in that manner does not fall prey to the disease of material infatuation. Thus devoid of selfish attachment, and endowed with the ability to see things in relation to the Lord, all sense objects are then directly perceived as being Lord Mādhava Himself.

#### 13

    se jukta-vairāgya,     tāhā to’ saubhāgya, tāhāi jaḍete harir vaibhava
    kīrtane jāhār,       pratiṣṭhā-sambhār, tāhār sampatti kevala kaitava

This is the standard of befitting renunciation, and one who realizes this is most fortunate indeed. Every- thing involved in such a devotee’s life represents Lord Hari’s personal spiritual opulence as manifest in the world of matter. On the other hand, one who engages in chanting the Lord’s Name with hopes of enhancing his own material reputation finds that all his activities and paraphernalia represent only the riches of hypocrisy.

#### 14

    viṣoya-mumukṣu,     bhoger bubhukṣu, du’ye tyajo mana, dui avaiṣṇava
    kṛṣṇer sambandha, aprākṛta-skandha,

kobhu nāhe tāhā jaḍer sambhava
Oh mind, please reject the company of two types of persons—those desiring impersonal liberation from the material world, and those who desire to enjoy the pleasure of material sense objects. Both of these are equally non-devotees. The things that are used in rela- tion to Lord Krishna are objects belonging directly to the transcendental realm, and thus having nothing to do with matter they cannot be either owned or forsaken by per- sons interested in mundane enjoyment or renunciation.

#### 15

    māyāvādī jana,      kṛṣṇetara mana, mukta abhimāne se ninde vaiṣṇava
    vaiṣṇavera dāsa,  tava bhakti-āśa, keno vā ḍākicho nirjana-āhava

An impersonal philospher is opposed to thinking of Krishna as an object of devotion, and thus being puffed up with the false pride of imaginary liberation he dares to criticize the true devotees of the Lord. Oh mind, you are the servant of the Vaiṣṇavas, and you should always hope for attaining devotion. Why then do you make such a loud commotion by calling to me and trying to prove the sup- posed supremacy of your practice of solitary worship?

#### 16

    je phalgu-vairāgī,     kohe nije tyāgī, se nā pāre kobhu hoite vaiṣṇava
    hari-pada chāḍi’, nirjanatā bāḍi,
    labhiyā ki phol, phalgu se vaibhava

One who falsely gives up things that could actu- ally be used in the Lord’s service proudly calls himself a ‘renunciate,’ but unfortunately he can never become a Vaiṣṇava by such an attitude. Abandoning his servitor- ship to the lotus feet of Lord Hari, and resigning himself to his solitary home—whatever is gained by that exercise can only be the worthless treasure of deception.

#### 17

    rādhā-dāsye rohi,    chāḍi bhoga-ahi, pratiṣṭhāśā nahe kīrtana-gaurava
    rādhā-nitya-jana,    tāhā chāḍi mana, keno vā nirjana-bhajana-kaitava

Ever engage yourself in the service of Śrī Rādhā, and keep aloof from the vicious snake of materialis- tic sense gratification. The glory of participating in the Lord’s kīrtan is not meant to bolster anyone’s ambitions for personal recognition. Oh mind, why then have you abandoned the identity of being Rādhā’s eternal servant in favour of retiring to a solitary place to practice the cheating process of so-called bhajan?

#### 18

    vraja-vāsī-gaṇa,   prachāraka-dhana, pratiṣṭhā-bhikṣuka tārā nahe śava
    prāṇa āche tāra,   se-hetu prachāra, pratiṣṭhāśā-hīna-‘kṛṣṇa-gāthā’ saba

The most valuable treasures amongst the Lord’s preachers are the eternal personalities residing in Vra- ja-dhām. They never occupy themselves with begging for worthless material reputation, which is cherished only by the living dead. The Vraja-vāsīs are truly infused with life, and therefore they preach in order to give life to the walking corpses of the mundane world. All the songs that the Vraja-vāsīs sing about the glories of Lord Krishna are devoid of any tinge of desire for fame.

#### 19

    śrī-dayita-dāsa,    kīrtanete āśa, kara uchaiḥ-svare harināma rava
    kīrtana-prabhāve,    smaraṇa svabhāve, se kāle bhajana-nirjana sambhava

This humble servant of Rādhā and Her beloved Krishna always hopes for kīrtan, and he begs all to loudly sing the Names of Lord Hari. The transcendental pow- er of congregational chanting automatically awakens re- membrance of the Lord and His divine Pastimes in rela- tion to one’s own eternal spiritual form. Only at that time does it become possible to go off to a solitary place and engage in the confidential worship of Their Lordships.
