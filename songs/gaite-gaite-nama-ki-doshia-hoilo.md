# Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

### Song 7a

    yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa chakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitaṁ śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me

“Oh Govinda! Without You, the world is empty. Tears are flooding my eyes like rain, and a moment seems like forever.”

#### 1

    gāite gāite nāma ki dośā hoilo
    ‘kṛṣṇa-nitya-dāsa mui’ hṛdoye sphurilo

Chanting the Name again and again, what was my condition? Within my heart I realised, “I am an eternal servant of Krishna.”

#### 2

    jānilām māyā-pāśe e jaḍa-jagate govinda-virahe duḥkha pāi nānā-mate

I realised that I was bound by Māyā’s ropes, in this dull mundane universe, and I simply experience misery in various ways due to separation from Lord Govinda.

#### 3

    āro je saṁsāra mora nāhi lāge bhālo kā̐hā jāi kṛṣṇa heri e chintā biśālo

And I don’t much like this world of birth and death. Where shall I go to see Krishna? This was my biggest worry.

#### 4

    kā̐dite kā̐dite mora ā̐khi-boriṣoya barṣā-dhārā heno chakṣe hoilo udoya

I began weeping and weeping; my tears fell. Torrents of rain poured from my eyes just like the rains of the monsoon season.

#### 5

    nimeṣa hoilo mora śata-juga-sam govinda-viraha āra sohite akṣam

Now, a moment for me is like a hundred ages. I cannot bear this separation from Lord Govinda.

#### 6

    śūnya dharā-tala,  chaudike dekhiye, parāṇa udāsa hoya
    ki kori, ki kori,     sthira nāhi hoya, jīvana nāhiko roya

The world is empty; as I survey the four directions, the entire surface of the world is void. My life is empty, my mind is listless; I am indifferent and apathetic towards everything. Depressed, melancholy and forlorn, my life has no meaning now. What do I do now? I cannot remain steady. I can no longer maintain my life.

#### 7

    vraja-vāsi-gaṇa  mora prāṇa rākho dekhāo śrī-rādhā-nāthe
    bhakativinoda-  minati māniyā, laohe tāhāre sāthe

Oh residents of Vṛndāvan; save my life and show me Rādhānāth, the Lord of Śrī Rādhā. Considering this humble prayer of Bhakti Vinod, please give him Your association and take him with You.

#### 8

    śrī kṛṣṇa-viraha āro sohite nā pāri parāṇa chāḍite āro din dui chāri

I am unable to further tolerate this separation from my Lord Krishna and am ready to give up my life in two days or four.
