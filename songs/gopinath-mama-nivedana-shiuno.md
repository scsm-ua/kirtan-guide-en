# Nivedana

## by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur Part 1

#### 1

    gopīnāth,  mama nivedana śuno
    viṣoyī durjana,      sadā kāma-rata, kichu nāhi mora guṇa

Oh Gopīnāth, Lord of the gopīs, please hear my submission. I am a wicked materialist, always addicted to worldly desires, and no good qualities do I possess.

#### 2

    gopīnāth,  āmāra bharasā tumi tomāra charaṇe,  loinu śaraṇa, tomāra kiṅkara āmi

Oh Gopīnāth, You are my only hope, and therefore I have taken shelter at Your lotus feet. I am now Your eternal servant.

#### 3

    gopīnāth,  kemone śodhive more nā jāni bhakati,  karme jaḍamati, poḍechi saṁsāra ghore

Oh Gopīnāth, how will You purify me? I do not know what devotion is, and my materialistic mind is absorbed in fruitive work. I have fallen into this dark and perilous worldly existence.

#### 4

    gopīnāth,  sakali tomāra māyā nāhi mama bala, jñāna sunirmala,
    svādhīna nahe e kāyā

Oh Gopīnāth, everything here is Your illusory energy. I have no strength or transcendental knowledge, and this body of mine is not independent and free from the control of material nature.

#### 5

    gopīnāth,  niyata charaṇe sthāna māge e pāmara,  kā̐diyā kā̐diyā,
    karahe karuṇā dāna

Oh Gopīnāth, this sinner, who is weeping and weeping, begs for an eternal place at Your divine feet. Please give him Your mercy.

#### 6

    gopīnāth,  tumi to sakali pāro durjane tārite,    tomāra śakati,
    ke āche pāpīra āro

Oh Gopīnāth, You are able to do anything, and therefore You have the power to deliver all sinners. Who is there that is more of a sinner than myself?

#### 7

    gopīnāth, tumi kṛpā-pārābāra
    jīvera kāraṇe,     āsiyā prapañche, līlā koile subistāra

Oh Gopīnāth, You are the ocean of mercy. Having come into this phenomenal world, You expand Your divine Pastimes for the sake of the fallen souls.

#### 8

    gopīnāth, āmi ki doṣera doṣī
    asura sakala,     pāilo charaṇa, vinoda thākilo bosi

Oh Gopīnāth, I am so sinful that although all the demons attained Your lotus feet, Bhakti Vinod has remained in worldly existence.
