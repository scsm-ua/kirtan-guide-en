# Kobe ho’be bolo

## by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    kobe ho’be bolo se-dina āmār
    (āmār) aparādha ghuchi’,    śuddha nāme ruchi, kṛpā-bole ho’be hṛdoye sañchār

Please tell me, when will that day be mine—when my offences will end and a taste for the pure Holy Name will be infused within my heart by the power of divine grace?

#### 2

    tṛṇādhika hīna,    kobe nije māni, sahiṣṇutā-guṇa hṛdoyete āni’
    sakale mānada,   āpani amānī, hoye āsvādibo nāma-rasa-sār

Considering myself lower than a blade of grass, bringing the quality of forbearance into my heart, showing respect to all, myself being freed from all false pride— when will I taste the essence of the liquid nectar of the Holy Name?

#### 3

    dhona jon āra,       kobitā-sundarī, bolibo nā chāhi deho-sukha-karī
    janme-janme dāo,    ohe gaurahari! ahaitukī bhakti charaṇe tomār

Wealth, following, beautiful women, as described in worldly poetry—I do not want any such bodily pleasures. O Lord Gaurahari, please give me unmotivated devotion to Your lotus feet, birth after birth.

#### 4

    (kobe) korite śrī-kṛṣṇa-   nāma uchāraṇa, pulakita deho gadgada vachana
    baibarṇya-bepathu   hobe saṅghaṭana, nirantara netre bo’be aśru-dhār

When, while articulating the divine Name of Śrī Krishna, will my body be thrilled in ecstatic rapture and my words choked with emotion? When will pallor and ecstatic trembling occur, and when will streams of tears flow constantly from my eyes?

#### 5

    kobe navadvīpe, suradhunī-taṭe,
    ‘gaura-nityānanda’ boli’ niṣkapaṭe nāchiyā gāiyā,       beḍāibo chuṭe,
    bātulera prāya chāḍiyā vichār

When, in the land of Nabadwīp, on the banks of the Ganges, will I run about, guilelessly calling, “O Gaura! O Nityānanda!” dancing and singing like a madman, giving up all considerations?

#### 6

    kobe nityānanda, more kori’ dayā, chāḍāibe mora viṣoyera māyā
    diyā more nija-      charaṇera chāyā, nāmera hāṭete dibe adhikār

When will Lord Nityānanda be merciful to me and release me from the illusion of worldliness? Giving me the shade of His lotus feet, when will He allow me to enter the marketplace of the Holy Name?

#### 7

    kinibo, luṭibo,     hari-nāma-rasa, nāma-rase māti’ hoibo vivaśa
    rasera rasika-       charaṇa paraśa, koriyā mojibo rase anibār

I shall buy and plunder the mellow of the Name Hari, and becoming thoroughly intoxicated by those liquid mellows of the Holy Name, I shall become stunned. By touching the feet of those great souls who are able to relish those mellows, I will be constantly immersed in the sweet nectar of the Holy Name.

#### 8

    kobe jīve dayā,    hoibe udoya, nija-sukha bhuli’ sudīna-hṛdoya
    bhakativinoda,      koriyā binoya, śrī-ājñā-ṭoholo koribe prachār

When will there be an awakening of compassion for all fallen souls, and when will this Bhakti Vinod, forgetting his own happines, with a meek heart set out to propagate by humble entreaty the sacred order of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu?
