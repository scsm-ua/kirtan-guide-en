        emona gaurāṅga bine nāhi āra
    heno avatāra    hobe ki hoyeche
        heno prema parachāra

No one is like Lord Gaurāṅga! Will there ever be an incarnation like Him, an incarnation that preached ecstatic love of Godhead as He did?

    duramati ati    patita pāṣaṇḍī
        prāṇe nā mārilo kore
    harināma diye    hṛdoya śodhilo
        jachi giyā ghore ghore

He did not kill the fallen wicked-hearted blasphemers. Instead He went from house to house visiting them. He begged them to chant Lord Krishna’s Holy Names. He gave them the Holy Names and purified their hearts.

    bhava biriñchira    vāñchito je prema
        jagata phelilo ḍhāli
    kāṅgāle pāiyā    khā-ilo nāchiye
        bājāiye karatāli

To the world He freely gave the rare gift of ecstatic love of Godhead, a gift even Brahmā and Shiva attain only with great difficulty. Attaining that gift, the poor people of this world danced and clapped their hands.

    hāsiye kā̐diye    preme gaḍāgaḍi
        pulake byāpilo aṅga
    chaṇḍāle brāhmaṇe    kore kolākuli
        kobe bā chilo e raṅga

They laughed and wept. Overcome with ecstasy, they rolled on the ground. The hairs of their bodies stood erect. The *brāhmaṇs* and *chaṇḍāls* embraced. There was great bliss.

    ḍākiye hā̐kiye    khol karatāle
        gāiye dhāiye phire
    dekhiyā śamana    tarāsa pāiye
        kapāṭa hānilo dvāre

Loudly they called out the Holy Names playing the *mṛdaṅga* and *karatāls*. They sang, ran, and danced in a circle. Seeing all this, peaceful composure became afraid, fled, and knocked on people’s doors.

    e tina bhuvana    ānande bhorilo
        uṭhilo maṅgala sora
    kohe premānanda    emona gaurāṅga
        rati nā janmilo mora

An auspicious tumult arose. The three worlds were filled with bliss. Premānanda says: “Alas! Attachment for Lord Gaurāṅga did not arise in me.”
