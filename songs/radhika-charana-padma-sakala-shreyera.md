### Song 1

#### 1

    rādhikā-charaṇa-padma, sakala śreyera sadma, jatane je nāhi ārādhilo
    rādhā-padāṅkita dhāma,  vṛndāvana jār nāma, tāhā je nā āśroya korilo

The lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā are the abode of all auspiciousness, the supreme goal of life. One who in his life has failed to take shelter of that holy *dhāma* named Vṛndāvan which is decorated by the lotus-like Rādhā,…

#### 2

    rādhikā-bhāva-gambhīra, chitta jebā mahādhīra goṇ-soṅga nā koilo jīvane
    kemone se śyāmānanda, rasa-sindhu-snānānanda, lobhibe bujhoho ek-mane

…who in his life has failed to associate with the intimate of Śrī Rādhā who are deeply filled with Rādhā’s mood of devotion and who are greatly intelligent—how will such a person bathe in the rasa-sindhu, the ocean of ecstatic joy which is Śyāmasundar? You must singlemindedly understand this point.

#### 3

    rādhikā ujjvala-rasera āchārya
    rādhā-mādhava-śuddha-prema vichārya

Śrī Rādhā is the exemplary teacher of the mellows of conjugal love. Pure ecstatic love for Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava is what is to be considered and discussed.

#### 4

    je dhorilo rādhā-pada parama jatane se pāilo kṛṣṇa-pada amūlya-ratane

One who holds tightly to the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā with great care will certainly attain the priceless jewels of the lotus feet of Krishna.

#### 5

    rādhā-pada vinā kobhu kṛṣṇa nāhi mile rādhāra dāsīr kṛṣṇa sarva-vede bole

Without taking shelter of the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā, one will never meet Krishna. All the Vedas say that Krishna belongs to the maidservants of Śrī Rādhā.

#### 6

    choḍata dhona-jon,   kalatra-suta-mita, choḍata karama geyān
    rādhā-pada-paṅkaja,  madhurata sevana, bhakativinoda paramāṇ

Having given up wealth, followers, wife, children, family, and friends, material activities and intellectual knowledge, one should become absorbed in the divine sweetness of service to the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā as one of Her maidservants in *madhura-rasa* . This is Bhakti Vinod’s solemn declaration.
