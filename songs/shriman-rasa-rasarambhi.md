# Śrī-Śrī-Guru-Gaurāṅga-Rādhā-Gopīnāthjīu 

## Hāpāniyā, Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Ashram

    śrīmān rāsa-rasārambhī
        vaṁśī-vaṭa-taṭa-sthitaḥ
    karṣan veṇu-svanair gopīr
        gopīnāthaḥ śriye ’stu naḥ

Śrī Gopīnāth, who instigates the exchange of devotional mellows, is standing upon the banks of the Yamunā River at the special place known as Vaṁśīvaṭa. There, the sweet tune of His flute is naturally attracting the hearts of the cowherd maidens of Vraja Dhām. May that charming Lord bring us within His auspicious embrace.
