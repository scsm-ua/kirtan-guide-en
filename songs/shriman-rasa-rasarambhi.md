# Śrī-Śrī-Guru-Gaurāṅga-Rādhā-Gopīnāthjīu Hāpāniyā, Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Ashram

    śrīmān rāsa-rasārambhī vaṁśī-vaṭa-taṭa-sthitaḥ
    karṣan veṇu-svanair gopīr gopīnāthaḥ śriye ’stu naḥ

Śrī Gopīnāth, who instigates the exchange of devo- tional mellows, is standing upon the banks of the Ya- munā River at the special place known as Vaṁśīvaṭa. There, the sweet tune of His flute is naturally attracting the hearts of the cowherd maidens of Vraja Dhām. May that charming Lord bring us within His auspicious em- brace.

    vṛndāyai tulasī-devyai
    priyāyai keśavasya cha kṛṣṇa-bhakti-prade devi
    satyavatyai namo namaḥ

I eternally offer my respects unto Śrī Vṛndādevī, Śrīmatī Tulasī Mahārāṇī, who is the dearmost object of Lord Keśava’s affection. I bow down before Satyavatī who can bestow pure dedication unto Lord Krishna.

    atha natvā mantra-gurūn gurūn bhāgavatārthadān
    vyāsān jagat-gurūn natvā tato jayam udīrayet

Then, let me bow down before all my spiritual mas- ters: the guru who gave me the divine mantra, as well as all those who have taught me the meaning of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrīla Vyāsadeva, the spiritual master of the entire uni- verse and the giver of the all-conquering conclusions of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.

    jayaḥ sa-parikara śrī-śrī-guru-gaurāṅga-gāndharvā-gov- indasundar-pādapadmānāṁ jayastu!

Let the holy lotus feet of Śrī Gurudeva, Śrīman Mahāprabhu, and Śrī Śrī Gāndharvā-Govindasundar, along with Their eternal associates, be victorious over all!
