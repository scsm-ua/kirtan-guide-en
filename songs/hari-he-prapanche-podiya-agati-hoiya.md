# Bhajan-Lālasā

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    hari he!
    prapañche poḍiyā,    agati hoiyā,
        nā dekhi upāya āro
    agatira gati,    charaṇe śaraṇa,
        tomāya korinu sāra

O my Lord Hari! Having fallen into the illusion of this world, thus rendered helpless, I see no other means of deliverance but You. Since You are the only recourse for the helpless, I accept the shelter of Your lotus feet as most essential.

    karama geyāna,    kichu nāhi mora,
        sādhana bhajana nāi
    tumi kṛpā-moya,    āmi to’ kāṅgāla,
        ahaitukī kṛpā chāi

I have no background of pious activities, nor any knowledge, nor any regulated devotional practice. But You are full of compassion and kindness; therefore I, being indeed destitute, solicit Your causeless mercy.

#### 3

    vākya-mano-vega,    krodha-jihvā-vega,
        udara-upastha-vega
    miliyā e saba,    saṁsāre bhāsāye,
        diteche paramodvega

The powerful urges of speech, mind, anger, tongue, belly, and genitals have banded together to cast me adrift on the sea of this material world, thus causing me grievous trouble.

#### 4

    oneka jatane,    se saba damane,
        chāḍiyāchi āśā āmi
    anāthera nātha!    ḍāki tava nāma,
        ekhona bharasā tumi

After numerous endeavours to subdue these material demands, I have completely given up all hope. Oh Lord of the destitute! I call upon Your Holy Name, for now You are my only hope.
