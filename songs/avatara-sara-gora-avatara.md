# Avatāra Sāra

### by Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    avatāra sāra    gorā avatāra
        keno nā bhajili tā̐re
    kori nīre vāsa gelo nā piyāsa
        āpana karama phere

The incarnation of Śrī Gaura is the most excellent of all incarnations. Why haven’t I worshipped Him? It is as if I was surrounded by water but denied myself a drink, returning to my own fruitive activity.

    kaṇṭa-kera taru    sadāi sebili (mana)
        amṛta pā’bāra āśe
    prema-kalpataru    śrī gaurāṅga āmāra
        tāhāre bhabili biṣe

I chewed the thorns of the tree of worldly life and considered the blood that flowed through my mouth to be nectar. When offered the fruits of the wish-fulfilling tree of ecstatic love of Lord Gaurāṅga, I rejected them, thinking them to be poison.

    saura-bhera āśe    palāśa śuṅkili (mana)
        nāsāte paśilo kīṭa
    ‘ikṣu-daṇḍa’ bhāvi’    kāṭha chuṣili (mana)
        kemone pāibi miṭha

Desirous of smelling a sweet scent, I sniffed at what I thought to be a fragrant flower. Alas, that flower was odourless like the palāśa flower and instead an insect flew up my nose and bit me. Thinking material life to be sweet like sugarcane, I tried to taste its nectar. Instead, it was like chewing dry wood. In this way all my attempts at enjoyment were false.

#### 4

    ‘hāra’ boliyā    golāya parili (mana)
        śamana kiṅkora sāpa
    ‘śītala’ boliyā    āguna pohāli (mana)
        pāili bajara-tāpa

Admitting defeat, wasted and worn out, I await the snake of death. Declaring it to be cool and soothing, I have embraced the fire of material life, only to suffer intense misery, as if struck by lightning.

#### 5

    saṁsāra bhajili    śrī-gaurāṅga bhulili
        nā śunili sādhura kathā
    iha-parakāla    dukāla khoyāli (mana)
        khāili āpana māthā

Worshipping my family and my material life, I forgot Lord Gaurāṅga and didn’t listen to the instructions of the saints. Now in my final days, I realise I have died twice, for not only am I leaving this mortal body, but I am also dead while living, having wasted my life in material indulgence.
