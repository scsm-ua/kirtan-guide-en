# Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nityānander Dayā

## by Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    parama karuṇa,     pahu̐ dūi jana, nitāi gaurachandra
    saba avatāra-       sāra śiromaṇi, kevala ānanda-kanda

Lord Nitāi and Lord Gaurachandra, are the two most merciful lords. They are the crest-jewels of all incar- nations and the only source of transcendental ecstatic joy.

#### 2

    bhaja bhaja bhāi, chaitanya nitāi, sudṛḍha biśvāsa kori’
    viṣoya chāḍiyā,      se rase majiyā mukhe bolo hari hari

O brother! I implore you to worship Śrī Chait- anya-Nitāi with firm faith. Give up your attachment to sense gratification and merge into this nectar by chanting the Names of Hari.

#### 3

    dekho ore bhāi,      tri-bhuvane nāi emona dayāla dātā
    paśu pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidore, śuni jāra guṇa-gāthā

Look, O brother! There are no benefactors in the three worlds who are as merciful as Them. Even birds and animals are fulfilled and stones melt, by hearing the glories of Their qualities.

#### 4

    saṁsāre majiyā,     rohili poḍiyā, se pade nahilo āśa
    āpana karama,      bhuñjāye śamana, kohoye lochana-dāsa

Absorbed in the cycle of birth and death, having fallen by the wayside without any hope for achieving Their company, the lord of death will come and make you suffer the results of your activities—so sings Lochan Dās.
