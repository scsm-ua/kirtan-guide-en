# Nivedana

## Part 3

#### 1

    gopīnāth,  āmāra upāya nāi tumi kṛpā kori,    āmāre loile,
    saṁsāre udhāra pāi

Oh Gopīnāth, I have no means of success, but if You take me, having bestowed Your mercy upon me, then I will obtain deliverance from this world.

#### 2

    gopīnāth,  poḍechi māyāra phere dhon, dārā, suta,    ghireche āmāre,
    kāmete rekheche jere

Oh Gopīnāth, I have fallen into the perils of mate- rial illusion. Wealth, wife, and sons have surrounded me, and lust has wasted me away.

#### 3

    gopīnāth,  mana je pāgala mora
    nā māne śāsana,    sadā achetana, viṣoye royeche bhora

Oh Gopīnāth, my mind is crazy and does not care for any authority. It is always senseless and has remained in the dark pit of worldly affairs.

#### 4

    gopīnāth,  hāra je menechi āmi oneka jatana,    hoilo biphala, ekhona bharasā tumi

Oh Gopīnāth, I have accepted my defeat. All of my various endeavours were useless. Now You are the only hope.

#### 5

    gopīnāth,  kemone hoibe gati prabala indriya,    bośī-bhūta mana,
    nā chāḍe viṣoya-rati

Oh Gopīnāth, how shall I make any advancement when my mind has come under the control of the power- ful senses and does not abandon its attachment to mate- rialism?

#### 6

    gopīnāth,  hṛdoye bosiyā mora manake śamiyā,     loho nija pāne,
    ghuchibe vipada ghora

Oh Gopīnāth, after sitting down in the core of my heart and subduing my mind, please take me to You. In this way the horrible dangers of this world will disappear.

#### 7

    gopīnāth,  anātha dekhiyā more tumi hṛṣīkeśa,      hṛṣīka damiyā,
    tāro’ he saṁsṛti-ghore

Oh Gopīnāth, You are Hṛṣīkeśa, the Lord of the senses. Seeing me so helpless, please control these sens- es of mine and deliver me from this dark and perilous worldly existence.

#### 8

    gopīnāth,  golāya legeche phā̐sa
    kṛpā-asi dhori,    bandhana chediyā, vinode karaho dāsa

Oh Gopīnāth, the noose of materialism has be- come fixed around my neck. Taking up the sword of Your mercy and cutting this bondage, make this Bhakti Vinod Your humble servant.
