# Nivedana

## Part 2

#### 1

    gopīnāth,  ghuchāo saṁsāra-jvālā avidyā-jātanā,    āro nāhi sahe,
    janama-maraṇa-mālā

Oh Gopīnāth, please remove the torment of worldly existence. I can no longer tolerate the pain of ignorance and the repeated succession of rebirth and death.

#### 2

    gopīnāth,  āmi to kāmera dāsa viṣoya-vāsanā,    jāgiche hṛdoye,
    phāṅdiche karama phāṅsa

Oh Gopīnāth, indeed I am a servant of lust. Worldly desires are awakening in my heart, and thus the noose of fruitive work is beginning to tighten.

#### 3

    gopīnāth,  kobe vā jāgibo āmi kāma-rūpa ari,     dūre teyāgibo,
    hṛdoye sphuribe tumi

Oh Gopīnāth, when will I wake up and abandon afar this enemy of lust, and when will You manifest Yourself in my heart?

#### 4

    gopīnāth,  āmi to’ tomāra jon tomāre chāḍiyā,   saṁsāra bhajinu,
    bhuliyā āpana-dhana

Oh Gopīnāth, I am Your devotee, but having abandoned You and thus having forgotten my real treasure, I have worshiped this mundane world.

#### 5

    gopīnāth,  tumi to sakali jāno āpanāra jane,     daṇḍiyā ekhona,
    śrī-charaṇe deho sthāno

Oh Gopīnāth, You know everything. Now, having punished Your servant, please give him a place at Your lotus feet.

#### 6

    gopīnāth,  ei ki vichāra tava
    vimukha dekhiyā,   chāḍa nija-jane, na kara karuṇā-laba

Oh Gopīnāth, is this Your judgement, that seeing me averse to You, You abandon Your servant and don’t bestow even a particle of mercy upon him?

#### 7

    gopīnāth,  āmi to mūrakha ati
    kise bhālo hoya,  kabhu nā bujhinu, tāi heno mama gati

Oh Gopīnāth, I am certainly very foolish, and I have never known what is good for me. Therefore such is my condition.

#### 8

    gopīnāth,  tumi to paṇḍita-vara mūḍhera maṅgala,    sadā anveṣibe,
    e dāse nā bhāva para

Oh Gopīnāth, You are indeed the wisest person. Please look for a way to bring about auspiciousness for this fool, and please do not consider this servant as an outsider.
