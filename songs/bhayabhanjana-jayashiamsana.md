He (of divine form) came forth from the birthplace of the golden lotus - the ocean of the mellow of divine consorthood. His large, merciful eyes dispel (the suffering souls’) fear and proclaim (the surrendered souls’) victory. His tongue (constantly) vibrates the whole Earth planet with Śrī Krishna- *saṅkīrtan* , his beauty resplendent in the robes of the sun’s radiance (saffron) that purifies the uni- verse and dispels the suffering of material existence. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Śrī Vṛṣabhānunandinī, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

The devotees surrendered in pure devotion are eternally protected at his lotus feet. He is worshippable by the pure souls endowed with sincerity and good for- tune, and he accepts (even) those who obstruct the ser- vice of Śrī Hari, just to rectify them. As the very fountain- head of mercy upon all mobile and immobile beings, he crushes the inauspiciousness of the whole universe. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Śrī Vṛṣabhānunandinī, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

Like a miracle, his body moves with a joyful el- egance and charm beyond the world’s understanding, fulfilling the artist’s aspiration. (Or, dancing in Pastimes transcendental to the world, his artistic form incites di- vine love’s hankering). His intellect surpasses that of (even) the demigods, and he is nobility incarnate as the commander in-chief of the Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsīs* ( *tri- daṇḍi-yatis* ). The *sādhus* of profound intellect describe the nature of his personality as meticulously in the line of Śrī Sanātan, Śrī Rūpa, and Śrī Raghunāth, and they speak of him as being on the same plane as Śrī Jīvapāda (being superbly replete in perfect theistic conclusions). On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Śrī Vṛṣabhānunandinī, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

On the bank of Śrī Rādhā Kuṇḍa at Svānanda Sukhada Kuñja, he is devoted to the service of his Be- loved, and (furthermore) he is greatly endeared to the di- vine damsels of Vraja headed by Lalitā. He is most favou- rite to Kamala-mañjarī who is pre-eminent in Vṛndāvan, and with the glorious qualities of Guṇamañjarī he builds the residence of Śrī Hari. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Śrī Vṛṣabhānunandinī, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

He is immaculate joy incarnate, or, he is the gra- ciousness or the joy of Vimalā Devī. He manifested the Pastimes of his Advent at Puruṣottama Kṣetra in the holy land of Orissa, and he revealed his Pastimes of delivering the fallen souls and extending his mercy upon them (by awarding them the gift of divine love) at the ‘new isles,’ or Nabadwīp. Circumambulating Gaura Dhām in the same way as traditionally done at Vraja Dhām and Pu- ruṣottama Dhām, he continuously propagates - the lov- ing desire of Vraja, the divine abode of Vaikuṇṭha, and the holy name of Krishna. On his Day of Holy Advent, I (again and again) make my obeisance unto that dear as- sociate of Śrī Vṛṣabhānunandinī, and the servitors of his holy lotus feet.
