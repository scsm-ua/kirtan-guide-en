# Akrodha paramānanda

### by Śrīla Lochan Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    akrodha paramānanda nityānanda rāy
    abhimāna-śūnya nitāi nagare beḍāy

The great personality, Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, is free from anger and full of transcendental ecstasy. He wanders throughout the towns, free from false pride and arrogance.

#### 2

    adhama patita jīver dvāre dvāre giyā
    harināma mahāmantra dena bilāiyā

He travels from door to door to the homes of the fallen souls, freely distributing the Hare Krishna mahāmantra.

#### 3

    jāre dekhe tāre kohe dante tṛṇa kori
    āmāre kiniyā loho bhaja gaurahari

With straw between His teeth, He begs all who cross his path, “Worship Lord Gaurahari and you will purchase me.”

#### 4

    eta boli’ nityānanda bhūme goḍi jāy
    sonāra parvata jena dhūlāte loṭāy

Saying this Nityānanda falls to the ground, appearing like a golden mountain rolling in the dust.

#### 5

    heno avatāre jāra rati nā janmilo
    lochan bole sei pāpī elo āra gelo

Where attachment for such an incarnation has not arisen, Lochan Dās says that such a sinful person comes and goes in the cycle of repeated birth and death.
