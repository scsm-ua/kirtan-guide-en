The ferry-boat is the Holy Names of the Lord and the spiritual master is the captain. The oars are the out- stretched arms in the *saṅkīrtan* .

    sarva-jīva uddhāra hoilo premera bātāse lochana paḍiyā roilo karamera doṣe

The favourable wind is divine love for Lord Krish- na and all the fallen souls have been rescued on this boat. Only Lochan Dās is left behind due to the faults of his own misdeeds.
