# Siddhi-Lālasā

    kobe gaura-vane,    suradhunī-taṭe,
        ‘hā rādhe hā kṛṣṇa’ bo’le
    kāṅdiyā beḍābo,    deho-sukha chāḍi’,
        nānā latā-taru-tole

O when, O when will this soul chant in Gaura-forest on the Ganges banks the Holy Names “Rādhā,” and “Krishna” renouncing all the body’s joys and drenched with all the tears I’ve wept amidst the herbs, beneath a tree.

    śva-pacha-gṛhete,    māgiyā khāibo,
        pibo sarasvatī-jala
    puline puline    gaḍā-gaḍi dibo,
        kori’ kṛṣṇa-kolāholo

When, at some outcaste’s home shall I give up all thoughts of caste and beg to share with him humble *prasādam* and drink the water of the Saraswatī? Along the banks, my voice choked with my ecstasy I’ll chant “Krishna” in great delight.

    dhāma-vāsī jane,    praṇati koriyā,
        māgibo kṛpāra leśa
    vaiṣṇava-charaṇa-    reṇu gāya mākhi,
        dhari’ avadhūta-veśa

And when will I bow down before a resident of the holy *dhām* and beg from him a drop of mercy; when Oh when will I smear my body with dust from a Vaiṣṇava’s holy feet and wear the mendicant’s cloth?

#### 4

    gauḍa-vraja-bane,    bheda nā heribo,
        hoibo varaja-vāsī
    dhāmera svarūpa,    sphuribe nayane,
        hoibo rādhāra dāsī

Then I shall see no difference between the forest of Gauḍa and Vraja, and I will be transformed into a resident of the *dhām*. The true nature of the Lord’s abode will manifest itself to my eyes, and I will become a maidservant of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.
