# Śrīla Bhakti Sudhīr Goswāmī Mahārāj

    goswāminaṁ sudhīrākhyam govinda-preṣṭham āśraye
    gaura-gāthā-rataṁ nityaṁ śrīdhara-pāda-sevanam

“I take shelter in Śrīla Bhakti Sudhīr Goswāmī Mahārāja, Govinda Krishna’s favourite and Śrīla Govinda Mahārāja’s favourite, as he is addicted to always singing the glories of Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu, having taken eternal shelter in service to the lotus feet of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāja (Śrī Rādhā’s other self).”
