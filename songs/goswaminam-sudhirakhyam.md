# Śrīla Bhakti Sudhīr Goswāmī Mahārāj

    goswāminaṁ sudhīrākhyam govinda-preṣṭham āśraye
    gaura-gāthā-rataṁ nityaṁ śrīdhara-pāda-sevanam

“I take shelter in Śrīla Bhakti Sudhīr Goswāmī Mahārāja, Govinda Krishna’s favourite and Śrīla Govin- da Mahārāja’s favourite, as he is addicted to always sing- ing the glories of Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu, having taken eternal shelter in service to the lotus feet of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāja (Śrī Rādhā’s other self).”
