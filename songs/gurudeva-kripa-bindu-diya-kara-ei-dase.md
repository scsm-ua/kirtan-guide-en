    gurudeva!
    kṛpā-bindu diyā,    kara’ ei dāse,
        tṛṇāpekṣā ati dīna
    sakala-sahane,    bala diyā kara,
        nija-māne spṛhā-hīna

Gurudeva, give to this servant just one drop of mercy. I am lower than a blade of grass. Give me all help. Give me strength. Let me be as you are, without desires or aspirations.

    sakale sammān,    korite śakati,
        deho nātha! yathā yatha
    tobe to’ gāibo,    harināma-sukhe,
        aparādha hobe hoto

Give me energy so that I can properly give respect and honour to all. Then I shall be able to happily chant the Holy Name, and my offences will go away.

    kobe heno kṛpā,    lobhiyā e jana,
        kṛtārtha hoibe, nātha!
    śakti-buddhi-hīn,    āmi ati dīn,
        kara more ātma-sātha

Oh my Lord! When will such mercy fall to this person. I am weak, bereft, and devoid of intelligence. Please allow me to be with you.

    jogyatā-vichāre,    kichu nāhi pāi,
        tomāra karuṇā-sāra
    karuṇā nā hoile,    kā̐diyā kā̐diyā,
        prāṇa nā rākhibo āra

If you examine me, you will find no qualities. Your mercy is everything to me. If you are not merciful unto me, I can only weep, and I will not be able to maintain my life.
