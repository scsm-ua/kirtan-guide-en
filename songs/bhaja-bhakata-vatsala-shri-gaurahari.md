    bhaja bhakata-vatsala śrī-gaurahari
    śrī-gaurahari sohi goṣṭha-bihārī,
    nanda-jaśomatī-chitta-hārī

Just  worship  Śrī  Gaurahari,  who  is  always affectionate toward His devotees. He is the same Supreme Godhead, Krishna, who sported in the cowherd pastures of Vraja and stole the hearts of Nanda and Yaśodā.

#### 2

    belā ho’lo, dāmodara, āisa ekhano
    bhoga-mandire bosi’ koraho bhojana

Mother Yaśodā calls to Krishna, “My dear Dāmodar, it is very late. Please come right now, sit down in the dining hall, and take your lunch.”

    nandera nirdeśe baise giri-vara-dhārī
    baladeva-saha sakhā baise sāri sāri

On the direction of Nanda Mahārāj, Krishna, the holder of Govardhan Hill, sits down, and then all the cowherd boys, along with Krishna’s elder brother, Śrī Baladeva, sit down in rows to take their lunch.

#### 4

    śuktā-śākādi bhāji nālitā kuṣmāṇḍa
    ḍāli ḍālnā dugdha-tumbī dadhi mochā-ghaṇṭa

They are then served a feast of śuktā and various kinds of green leafy vegetables, then nice fried things, and a salad made of the green leaves of the jute plant. They are also served pumpkin, baskets of fruit, small square cakes made of lentils and cooked down milk, then thick yogurt, squash cooked in milk, and vegetable preparations made from the flower of the banana tree.

    mudga-boḍā māṣa-boḍā roṭikā ghṛtānna
    śaṣkulī piṣṭaka kṣīr puli pāyasānna

Then they receive fried squares of mung dal patties, and urad dal patties, chapātīs, and rice with ghee. Next, sweets made with milk, sugar, and sesamum; rice flour cakes; thick cooked-down milk; cakes floating in milk; and sweet rice.

#### 6

    karpūra amṛta–kelī rambhā kṣīra-sāra
    amṛta rasālā, amla dvādaśa prakāra

There is also sweet rice that tastes just like nectar due to its being mixed with camphor. There are bananas, and cheese which is nectarean and delicious. They are also served twelve kinds of sour preparations made with tamarinds, limes, lemons, oranges, and pomegranates.

#### 7

    luchi chini sarapurī lāḍḍu rasāvalī
    bhojana korena kṛṣṇa ho’ye kutūhalī

There are purīs made with white flour and sugar; purīs filled with cream; laḍḍus; and dal patties boiled in sugared rice. Krishna eagerly eats all of the food.

#### 8

    rādhikāra pakka anna vividha vyañjana
    parama ānande kṛṣṇa korena bhojana

In great ecstasy and joy Krishna eats the rice, curried  vegetables,  sweets,  and  pastries  cooked  by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

#### 9

    chole-bole lāḍḍu khāy śrī-madhumaṅgala
    bagala bājāy āra deya hari-bolo

Krishna’s funny *brāhmaṇ* friend Madhumaṅgal, who is very fond of laḍḍus, gets them by hook or by crook. Eating the laḍḍus he shouts, “Haribol! Haribol!” and makes a funny sound by slapping his sides under his armpits with his hands.

#### 10

    rādhikādi gaṇe heri’ nayanera koṇe
    tṛpta ho’ye khāy kṛṣṇa yaśodā-bhavane

Beholding Rādhārāṇī and Her *gopī* friends out of the corners of His eyes, Krishna eats at the house of Mother Yaśodā with great satisfaction.

#### 11

    bhojanānte piye kṛṣṇa suvāsita vāri
    sabe mukha prakṣāloy ho’ye sāri sāri

After lunch, Krishna drinks rose-scented water. Then all of the boys, standing in lines, wash their mouths.

#### 12

    hasta-mukha prakṣāliyā jata sakhā-gaṇe
    ānande viśrāma kore baladeva-sane

After all the cowherd boys wash their hands and mouths, in great bliss they take rest with Lord Balarām.

#### 13

    jāmbula rasāla āne tāmbūla-maśālā
    tāhā kheye kṛṣṇa-chandra sukhe nidrā gelā

The two cowherd boys Jāmbula and Rasāla then bring Krishna *pān* made with betel nuts, fancy spices, and catechu. After eating that *pān*, Śrī Krishnachandra then happily goes to sleep.

#### 14

    viśālākṣa śikhi-pucha-chāmara ḍhulāya
    apūrva śayāya kṛṣṇa sukhe nidrā jāya

While  Krishna  happily  takes  His  rest  on  an excellent bedstead, His servant Viśālākṣa cools Him with a fan of peacock feathers.

#### 15

    jaśomatī-ājñā peye dhaniṣṭhā-ānito
    śrī-kṛṣṇa-prasāda rādhā bhuñje hoye prīto

At Mother Yaśodā’s request the *gopī* Dhaniṣṭhā brings remnants of food left on Krishna’s plate to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, who eats them with great delight.

#### 16

    lalitādi sakhī-gaṇa avaśeṣa pāya
    mane mane sukhe rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāya

Lalitā-devī and the other *gopīs* then receive the remnants, and within their hearts they sing the glories of Rādhārāṇī and Krishna with great joy.

#### 17

    hari-līlā ek-mātra jāhāra pramoda
    bhogārati gāy ṭhākur bhakativinoda

Ṭhākur Bhakti Vinod, whose one and only joy is the Pastimes of Lord Hari, sings this Bhog Ārati song.

    bhaja govinda govinda gopāla
    giridhārī gopīnātha nanda dulala
    bhaja govinda govinda gopāla
    nanda dulala jaya jaya śachī dulala
    śachī dulala jaya jaya gaura gopāla
