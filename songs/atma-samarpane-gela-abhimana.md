    ātma-samarpaṇe gelā abhimāna
    nāhi karabu̐ nija rakṣā-vidhān

Surrendering my soul unto You has lifted from me the burden of false pride. No longer will I try to provide for my own safety.

    pālya godhana jāni kori’ tuyā sāth

I know that You will give protection to Your treasured possessions, Oh Lord. I now understand the mentality of Your treasured cows safely maintained by Your side.

    charāobi mādhava! yamunā-tīre
    baṁśī bājāoto ḍākobi dhīre

When You lead Your herds to pasture, Oh Mādhava, on the banks of the Yamunā river, You will call to them by softly playing on Your flute.

    agha-baka mārato rakṣā-vidhāna
    karabi sadā tuhu̐ gokula-kāna!

By slaying great demons such as Aghāsura and Bakāsura You will always provide full protection, Oh Kān of Gokul!

    rakṣā karabi tuhu̐ niśchoy jāni
    pāna karabu̐ hām jāmuna-pāni

Fearless and confident of Your protection, I will drink the waters of the Yamunā.

    kālīya-dokha karabi vināśā
    śodhobi nadī-jala, bāḍāobi āśā

The Kālīya serpent’s venom poisoned the Yamunā’s waters, yet that poison will be vanquished. You will purify the Yamunā, and by such heroic deeds enhance our faith.

    piyato dāvānala rākhobi moy
    ‘gopāla’, ‘govinda’ nāma tava hoy

You will surely protect me by swallowing the forest fire. Thus You are called Gopāl (protector of the cows) and Govinda (pleaser of the cows).

    rākhobe varṣaṇe, giri-vara-dhāri!

In order to curb the malice of Indra, king of the demigods, You will protect me from his torrents of rain, Oh lifter of the mighty Govardhan Hill!

    chatur-ānana korabo jabo chori
    rakṣā karabi meye, gokula-hari!

When the four-headed Brahmā abducts me along with Your cowherd boyfriends and calves, then also You will surely protect me, Oh Gokul Hari!

    bhakativinoda—tuyā gokula-dhan
    rākhobi keśava! korato jatan

Bhakti Vinod is now the property of Gokul, Your holy abode. Oh Keśava! Kindly protect him with gentle loving care.
