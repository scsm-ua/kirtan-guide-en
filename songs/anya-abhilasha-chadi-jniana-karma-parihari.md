### by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    anya-abhilāṣa chāḍi    jñāna karma parihari
        kāya mane koribo bhajana
    sādhu-saṅge kṛṣṇa-sevā    nā pūjibo devī-devā
        ei bhakti parama-kāraṇa

Worship the Lord with body and mind, giving up the desire for material endeavour and mundane knowledge. Perform service in the association of devotees and do not worship the various demigods. These activities are the prime cause of devotion to Krishna.

#### 2

    mahājanera jei patha    tā’te ho’be anurata
        pūrvāpara koriyā vichāra
    sādhana-smaraṇa-līlā    ihāte nā kara helā
        kāya mane koriyā sūsāra

The essence of devotional practice is to carefully consider and follow the path revealed by the great devotees. One should not neglect the practice of remembering the Pastimes of the Lord, for devotional service should be performed with the mind as well as the body.

#### 3

    asat-saṅga sadā tyāga    chāḍa anya gīta-rāga
        karmī jñānī parihari dūre
    kevala bhakata-saṅga    prema-kathā-rasa-raṅga
        līlā-kathā vraja-rasa-pure

Always give up bad association and avoid singing mundane songs. Keep at a distance from materialistic people as well as those absorbed with mundane knowledge. Associate only with the devotees and merge in the happiness of topics of the loving Pastimes of Krishna in Vṛndāvan.

#### 4

    jogī nyāsī karmī jñānī    anya-deva-pūjaka dhyānī
        iha-loka dūre parihari
    karma dharma duḥkha śoka    jebā thāke anya joga
        chāḍi’ bhaja girivara-dhārī

Please give up the association of the *yogīs*, *sannyāsīs*, *karmīs*, *jñānīs*, meditators, and the worshippers of the demigods. Also abandon attachment for all varieties of fruitive activities, religious duties, distresses, lamentations and material objects. Just worship Krishna, the lifter of Govardhan Hill.

#### 5

    tīrtha-jātrā pariśrama    kevala-manera-bhrama
        sarva-siddhi govinda-charaṇa
    dṛdha-viśvāsa hṛde dhori    mada-mātsarya parihari
        sadā kara ananya bhajana

Travelling to the holy places is only so much hard labour to attain some mental illusion when really the lotus feet of Śrī Govinda are the perfection of one’s life. One should give up pride and envy and with firm determination in the heart, one should always perform unalloyed worship of the Lord.

#### 6

    kṛṣṇa-bhakta saṅga kori    kṛṣṇa-bhakta saṅga heri
        śraddhānvita śravaṇa-kīrtana
    archana vandana dhyāna    nava-bhakti mahā-jñāna
        ei bhakti parama-kāraṇa

The best process of devotional service is to hear, chant, worship, glorify and meditate with faith on the Names, Forms, Qualities and Pastimes of Krishna in the association of the devotees of Krishna through the nine forms of bhakti.

#### 7

    hṛsīke govinda-sevā    nā pūjibo devī-devā
        ei to’ ananya-bhakti-kathā
    āra jata upālambha    viśeṣa sakali dambha
        dekhite lāgaye mane vyathā

Engage the senses in the service of Śrī Govinda and do not worship the various demigods. This principle is in the line of unalloyed devotion. All other activities are simply done through pride and to see them gives great pain to one’s heart.

#### 8

    dehe baise ripū-gaṇa    jateka indriya-gaṇa
        keho kāra vādhya nāhi hoy
    śunile nā śune kāṇa    jānile nā jāne prāṇa
        daḍhāite nā pāre niścoy

The six enemies; lust, anger, greed, illusion, pride and envy and the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch reside in my body but I am unable to control them. Although I hear and understand repeatedly that one should serve Krishna with all his senses, still I cannot accept this fact with firm determination.

#### 9

    kāma krodha moha lobha
            mada mātsarya dambha-saha
        sthāne sthāne nijūkta koribo
    ānanda kori hṛdoy    ripu’ kori’ parājaya
        anāyāse govinda bhajibo

I will engage lust, anger, greed, illusion, envy and pride in their proper places. In this way, I will defeat the enemies and with ecstasy in my heart, I will worship Govinda without difficulty.

#### 10

    kāma kṛṣṇa-karmārpaṇe    krodha bhakta-dveśi-jane
        lobha sādhu-saṅge hari-kathā
    moha iṣṭa-lābha-bine    mada kṛṣṇa-guṇa-gāne
        nijūkta koribo jathā tathā

I will engage my lust in eagerness to serve Krishna and I will use my anger against those who are envious of the devotees. I will be greedy to hear the topics of Hari in the association of the devotees. I will be illusioned if I fail to achieve my worshipable Lord and I will feel proud to chant the glories of Krishna. In this way, I will engage them in their respective duties.

#### 11

    anyathā svatantra kāma    anarthādi jāra dhāma
        bhakti-pathe sadā deya bhaṅga
    kibā bā korite pāre    kāma-krodha sādhakere
        jadi hoy sādhu-janāra saṅga

Otherwise, independent lusty desires, which are the source of all unwanted things will always disturb the path of devotional service. What harm can lusty desires and anger do to a practioner of devotional service if they associate with devotees?

#### 12

    krodha bā nā kore kibā    krodha-tyāga sadā dibā
        lobha moha ei to’ kathana
    choya ripū sadā hīna    koribo maner adhīna
        kṛṣṇachandra koriyā smaraṇa

Anger spoils everything. Therefore, I will always give up anger, greed and illusion. I will control the six enemies with the help of my mind while remembering Lord Krishna.

#### 13

    āpani palābe saba    śuniyā govinda raba
        siṁha-rabe jena kori-gaṇa
    sakali vipatti jābe    mahānanda sūkha pābe
        jāra hoy ekānta bhajana

All the enemies will run away by hearing the sound vibration of Govinda’s name just as a deer flees upon hearing the roar of a lion. One who performs unalloyed devotional service will feel great happiness and all his dangers will be vanquished.

#### 14

    nā koriho asat-cheṣṭa    lābha pūjā pratiṣṭhā
        sadā chinta govinda-charaṇa
    sakala santāpa jābe    parānanda sukha pābe
        prema-bhakti parama-kāraṇa

Therefore my dear mind, do not endeavour for bad association, profit, adoration and distinction, but always remember the lotus feet of Govinda. Please engage in loving devotional service with great happiness and all your dangers will be destroyed.

#### 15

    asat-kriya kuṭināṭi    chāḍa anya paripāṭī
        anya deve nā koriho rati
    āpana āpana sthāne    pirīti sabāi ṭāne
        bhakti-pathe paḍaye bigati

Please give up all duplicity, illusory activities and the search for bodily happiness. Do not be attached to the worship of various demigods. Mundane love and affection for material relationships attracts everyone to their respective illusions and thus advancement on the path of devotional service is checked.

#### 16

    āpana bhajana-patha    tāhe hobo anūrata
        iṣṭa-deva-sthāne-līlā-gāna
    naiṣṭhika bhajana ei    tomāre kohinū bhāi
        hanumān tāhāte pramāṇa

Be continuously engaged on the path of devotional worship and be attached to glorifying the Pastimes of Śrī Krishna in Vṛndāvan. This process of devotional service is known as steady devotional service. The prime example of this is Hanumān.
