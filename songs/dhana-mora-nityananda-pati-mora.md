    dhana mora nityānanda  pati mora gaurachandra prāṇa mora jugala-kiśora
    advaita āchārya bala   gadādhara mora kula narahari vilasai mora

Lord Nityānanda is my wealth. Lord Gaurachandra is my master. The youthful Divine Couple is my life. Advaita Āchārya is my strength. Gadādhara is my family. Narahari Sarakara is my glory.

    vaiṣṇavera pada-dhūli   tāhe mora snāna-keli tarpaṇa mora vaiṣṇavera nāma
    vichāra koriyā mane   bhakti-rasa āsvādane madhyastha śrī-bhāgavata purāṇa

The dust of the devotees’ lotus feet is my bathing water.  The chanting of the devotees’ names is my satisfaction. Considering the merits of all Vedic literatures in the light of devotional service, I have concluded that the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam is the best of all scriptures.

    vaiṣṇavera uchiṣṭa     tāhe mora mano-niṣṭha vaiṣṇavera nāmete ullāsa
    vṛndāvane chaturā    tāhe mora mano-gherā kohe dīne narottama dāsa

My mind is firmly convinced of the spiritual benefit obtained by eating the remnants of foodstuff left by the devotees. The names of the devotees are my happiness. The land of Vṛndāvan is the enclosure within which I keep my mind. Poor-hearted Narottam Dās speaks in this way.
