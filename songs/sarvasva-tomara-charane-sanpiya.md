# Sarvasva tomāra

## by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    sarvasva tomāra,   charaṇe sa̐piyā, poḍechi tomāra ghore
    tumi to’ ṭhākur,    tomāra kukkur, boliyā jānaho more

Now taking all that I possess and surrendering it unto Your lotus feet, O Lord, I throw myself down be- fore Your house. You are the master of the house; kindly consider me Your own dog.

#### 2

    bā̐dhiyā nikaṭe,    āmāre pālibe, rohibo tomāra dvāre
    pratīpa-jonere,     āsite nā dibo, rākhibo goḍera pāre

Chaining me nearby, You will maintain me, and I shall lie at Your doorstep. I will not allow Your enemies to enter, but will keep them outside the bounds of the surrounding moat.

#### 3

    tava nija-jana,    prasād seviyā, uchiṣṭa rākhibe jāhā
    āmāra bhojana,   parama-ānande, prati-dina hobe tāhā

Whatever food remnants Your devotees leave be- hind after honouring Your prasād will be my daily suste- nance. I will feast on those remnants in great bliss.

    bosiyā śuiyā,    tomāra charaṇa, chintibo satata āmi
    nāchite nāchite,   nikaṭe jāibo, jokhona ḍākibe tumi

While sitting up or lying down, I will constantly meditate on Your lotus feet. Whenever You call me, I will immediately run to You and dance in rapture.

#### 5

    nijera poṣaṇa,     kobhu nā bhāvibo, rohibo bhāvera bhore
    bhakativinoda,    tomāra pālaka, boliyā varaṇa kore

I will never even think about arranging for my own nourishment, and will remain absorbed in ever cherish- ing love for my master. Bhakti Vinod now accepts You as his only maintainer.
