# Śrī Nṛsiṁha Praṇām

    namas te narasiṁhāya
    prahlādāhlāda-dāyine
    hiraṇyakaśipor vakṣaḥ-
    śilā-ṭaṅka-nakhālaye

I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasiṁha, who gives joy to Prahlād Mahārāj and whose nails are like chisels on the stonelike chest of the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu.

    ito nṛsiṁhaḥ parato nṛsiṁho
    yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ
    bahir nṛsiṁho hṛdaye nṛsiṁho
    nṛsiṁham ādiṁ śaraṇaṁ prapadye

Lord Nṛsiṁha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Nṛsiṁha is there. He is in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Nṛsiṁha, the origin of all things and the supreme refuge.

    tava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-śṛṅgaṁ
        dalita-hiraṇyakaśipu-tanu-bhṛṅgam
    keśava dhṛta-narahari-rūpa jaya jagadīśa hare

Oh Keśava! Oh Lord of the universe! Oh Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of half-man, half-lion! All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp between one’s fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasplike demon Hiraṇyakaśipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your beautiful lotus hands.
