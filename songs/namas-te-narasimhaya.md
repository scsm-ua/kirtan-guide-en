# Śrī Nṛsiṁha Praṇām

    namas te narasiṁhāya prahlādāhlāda-dāyine hiraṇyakaśipor vakṣaḥ- śilā-ṭaṅka-nakhālaye

I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasiṁha, who gives joy to Prahlād Mahārāj and whose nails are like chisels on the stonelike chest of the demon Hiraṇya- kaśipu.

    ito nṛsiṁhaḥ parato nṛsiṁho yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ bahir nṛsiṁho hṛdaye nṛsiṁho
    nṛsiṁham ādiṁ śaraṇaṁ prapadye

Lord Nṛsiṁha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Nṛsiṁha is there. He is in the heart and is out- side as well. I surrender to Lord Nṛsiṁha, the origin of all things and the supreme refuge.
