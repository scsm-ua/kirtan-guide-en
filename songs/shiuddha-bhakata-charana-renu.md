# Śuddha-bhakata

## by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    śuddha-bhakata- charaṇa-reṇu, bhajana-anukūla
    bhakata-sevā,     parama-siddhi, prema-latikāra mūla

Dust from the lotus feet of pure devotees is conducive to devotional service, while service to the Vaiṣṇavas is itself the supreme perfection and the root of the tender creeper of divine love.

#### 2

    mādhava-tithi,     bhakti-jananī, jatane pālana kori
    kṛṣṇa-basati,       basati boli’, parama ādare bori

I observe with great care the holy days like Ekādaśī and Janmāṣṭamī, for they are the mother of devotion. As my dwelling place I choose with the greatest reverence and love the transcendental abode of Śrī Krishna.

#### 3

    gaura āmāra,      je-saba sthāne, koralo bhramaṇa raṅge
    se-saba sthāna,      heribo āmi, praṇayi-bhakata-saṅge

All those places where my Lord Gaurasundar travelled for Pastimes I will visit in the company of loving devotees.

#### 4

    mṛdaṅga-bādya,    śunite mon, abasara sadā jāche
    gaura-bihita,       kīrtana śuni’, ānande hṛdoya nāche

My mind always begs for the opportunity to hear the music of the mṛdaṅga. Upon hearing the kind of kīrtan ordained by Lord Gaurachandra, my heart dances in ecstasy.

#### 5

    jugala-mūrti,    dekhiyā mora, parama-ānanda hoy
    prasāda-sevā     korite hoya, sakala prapañcha jay

By beholding the Deity forms of the divine couple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Krishna, I feel the greatest joy. By honouring the Lord’s prasādam I conquer over all worldly illusions.

#### 6

    je-dina gṛhe,      bhajana dekhi, gṛhete goloka bhāya
    charaṇa-sīdhu,     dekhiyā gaṅgā, sukha nā sīmā pāya

Goloka Vṛndāvan appears in my home whenever I see the worship and service of Lord Hari going on there. Upon seeing the Ganges, which is a river of nectar emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord, my happiness knows no bounds.

#### 7

    tulasī dekhi’,     juḍāya prāṇa, mādhava-toṣaṇī jāni’
    gaura-priya,      śāka-sevane, jīvana sārthaka māni

The sight of the holy Tulasī tree soothes my soul, for I know she gives pleasure to Lord Krishna. By honouring śāk [a green leafy vegetable preparation], a dear favourite of Lord Chaitanya, I consider life worthwhile.

#### 8

    bhakativinoda,   kṛṣṇa-bhajane, anukūla pāya jāhā
    prati-divase,      parama-sukhe, svīkāra karaye tāhā

Whatever Bhakti Vinod obtains that is conducive for the service of Śrī Krishna, he accepts every day with the greatest of joy.
