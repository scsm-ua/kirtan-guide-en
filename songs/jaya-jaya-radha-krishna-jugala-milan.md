Krishna is the attractor of Cupid, and His beautiful form is bending in three places with yellow garments and a charming peacock-feather crown.

Dressed in blue garments, Her complexion fair, and Her virtues glorious, King Vṛṣabhānu’s daughter, Śrīmatī Rādhikā is on the left of the charming Lord Mādhava.
