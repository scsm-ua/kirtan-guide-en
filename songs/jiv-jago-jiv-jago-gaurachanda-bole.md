#### 1

    jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo, gaurāchā̐da bole
    kota nidrā jāo māyā-piśāchīra kole

Lord Gaurāṅga calls, “Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls! You have slept so long in the lap of the witch Māyā.”

#### 2

    bhajibo boliyā ese saṁsāra-bhitore
    bhuliyā rohile tumi avidyāra bhore

“You came into this world saying, ‘O my Lord, I will certainly worship You’, but having forgotten this promise, you have remained in great ignorance.”

#### 3

    tomāre loite āmi hoinu avatāra
    āmi vinā bandhu āra ke āche tomāra

“I have descended just to save you. Other than Myself, who else is your friend?”

#### 4

    enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi’
    hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi māgi’

“I have brought the medicine for destroying the illusion of *māyā*. Now pray for this Hari-nāma-mahāmantra and take it.”

#### 5

    bhakativinoda prabhura-charaṇe poḍiyā
    sei hari-nāma-mantra loilo māgiyā

Ṭhākur Bhakti Vinod fell at the lotus feet of Lord Gaurāṅga, and after begging for the Holy Name he received that *mahāmantra*.
