    ‘dayāl nitāi chaitanya’ bo’le nāch re āmār man
    nāch re āmār man, nāch re āmār man

Oh my mind, just dance! Oh my mind, just dance! Oh my mind, please dance, chanting, “Dayāl Nitāi Chaitanya!”

    (emon dayāl to nāi he, mār kheye prema dey)
    (tabe) aparādha dūre jābe, pābe prema-dhan
    (aparādhera-vichāra to nāi he)
    takhon kṛṣṇa-nāme ruchi habe, ghuchibe bandhan

Such a merciful personality as Nityānanda Prabhu is not to be found anywhere. He suffers a beating from Jagāi and Mādhāi and still gives them love of God.

When you become offenceless, you will obtain love of God; but in these Names of Chaitanya and Nitāi there is no consideration of offences. Once you have a taste for the Holy Name of Krishna, bondage to this world will come to an end.

    (anurāg to habe he)
    tokhon anāyāse saphal habe jīvera jīvan
    (kṛṣṇa-rati vinā jīvan to miche he)
    śeṣe vṛndāvane rādhā-śyāmer pābe daraśan
    (gaura-kṛpā hole he)

When there is attachment to the Holy Name of Krishna, then, very easily, the life of a living being becomes successful. Without attachment to Krishna, life is simply false. If the mercy of Lord Gaura is there, then at the end of life you will obtain the beautiful vision of Rādhā and Śyāma in Vṛndāvan.
