# Ātma-nivedana

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ātma-nivedana,    tuyā pade kori,
        hoinu parama sukhī
    duḥkha dūre gelo,    chintā nā rohilo,
        chaudike ānanda dekhi

I have become supremely joyful by surrendering myself at Your holy feet. Unhappiness has gone away, and there are no more anxieties. I see joy in all directions.

#### 2

    aśoka-abhaya,    amṛta-ādhāra,
        tomāra charaṇa-dvaya
    tāhāte ekhona,    viśrāma lobhiyā
        chāḍinu bhavera bhaya

Your two lotus feet are reservoirs of immortal nectar where one may live free from sorrow and fear. I have found peace there now and have given up the fear of worldly existence.

#### 3

    tomāra saṁsāre,    koribo sevana,
        nahibo phalera bhāgī
    tava sukha jāhe,    koribo jatana,
        ho’ye pade anurāgī

I shall render service in Your household and not endeavour to enjoy the fruits of that service, but rather I shall strive for whatever pleases You, fully devoted to Your lotus feet.

#### 4

    tomāra sevāya,    duḥkha hoya jato,
        seo to’ parama sukha
    sevā-sukha-duḥkha,    parama sampada
        nāśoye avidyā-duḥkha

Troubles encountered in Your service shall be the cause of great happiness, for in Your devotional service joy and sorrow are equally great riches. Both destroy the misery of ignorance.

#### 5

    pūrva itihāsa,    bhulinu sakala,
        sevā-sukha pe’ye mane
    āmi to’ tomāra,    tumi to’ āmāra,
        ki kāja apara dhane

I have completely forgotten all past history by feeling great joy in my mind. I am most certainly Yours, and You are indeed mine. What need is there of any other treasure?

#### 6

    bhakativinoda,    ānande ḍubiyā,
        tomāra sevāra tore
    saba cheṣṭā kore,    tava ichā-mata,
        thākiyā tomāra ghore

Bhakti Vinod, diving into the ocean of bliss, devotes all his efforts for Your service and dwells in Your house according to Your wishes.
