# Hare Krishna mahāmantra

### Illumination by Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj

In the Name of Rāma within the Hare Krishna mantra, the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas will find Rādhā-ramaṇa Rāma. That means, “Krishna, who gives pleasure (*ramaṇ*) to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.” In our conception, the Hare Krishna mantra is wholesale Krishna consciousness, not Rāma  (Lord  Rāmachandra)  consciousness.  Śrī  Chaitanya’s highest conception of things is always *svayaṁ bhagavān*, Krishna-*līlā*, Rādhā-Govinda-*līlā*. That is the real purpose of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s advent and teachings.

In that consideration, the Hare Krishna mantra does not mention the Rāma-*līlā* of Āyodhya at all. There is no connection with that in the highest conception of the Hare Krishna mantra.  The inner conception of the mantra is responsible for our spiritual attainment. The inner conception of the devotee will guide them to their destination.
