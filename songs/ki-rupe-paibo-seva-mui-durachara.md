# Ki-rūpe pāibo sevā

## by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ki-rūpe pāibo sevā mui durāchāra
    śrī-guru-vaiṣṇave rati na hoilo āmāra

I have no devotional attachment for either the Vaiṣṇavas or my Spiritual Master. How is it possible for a rascal like me to attain devotional service?

#### 2

    aśeṣa māyāte mana magana hoilo vaiṣṇavete leśa-mātra rati nā janmilo

My mind is always drowning in illusion. I have not even the smallest fragment of devotion for the Vaiṣṇavas.

#### 3

    biṣoye bhuliya andha hoinu divā-niśi gole phā̐sa dite phere māyā se piśāchī

I have become blind by constantly meditating on the objects of the senses. The witch Māyādevī has placed a hangman’s noose around my neck.

#### 4

    māyāre koriyā jaya chāḍāna na jāya sādhu-kṛpā vinā āro nahiko upāya

Even if I can cure my blindness and defeat Māyā in the form of this hangman, I cannot become free from material illusion without the mercy of the saintly devotees.

#### 5

    adoṣa daraśi-prabhu patita-uddhāra ei-bāro narottame karaho nistāra

Oh master, Oh purifier of the sinful, Oh saviour of the fallen souls, you do not see the faults of others, please rescue this Narottam Dās.
