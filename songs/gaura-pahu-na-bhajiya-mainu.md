# Gaurā Pahu̐

## by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    gaurā pahu̐ nā bhajiyā mainu
    prema ratana-dhana helāya hārāinu

O Lord Gaura! I have not worshiped You and have been robbed of the jewel of divine love by my own negligence.

#### 2

    adhane jatana kori dhana teyā-ginu
    āpana karama doṣe āpani ḍuvinu

Although I am in need of Your wealth, I have endeavoured to reject Your riches and instead I have dived into sinful material activity.

#### 3

    sat-saṅga chāḍi koinu asate vilāsa
    te-kāraṇe lāgilo je karma-bandha-phāṅsa

Avoiding the association of saintly persons, I have enjoyed sporting with materialistic people. For that reason I have become bound in the noose of fruitive activity and its reactions.

#### 4

    viṣoya-biṣama-biṣa satata khāinu
    gaura-kīrtana rase magana nā hoinu

I have perpetually drunk the horrible poison of material sense gratification and have never become absorbed in the sweet nectar of the chanting of Lord Gaura’s Names.

#### 5

    keno bā āchaye prāṇa ki sukha lāgiyā
    narottama dāsa keno nā gelo moriyā

O why has my heart not experienced any satisfaction and why has Narottam Dās not simply perished?
