#### 1

    je ānilo prema-dhana karuṇā prachura
    heno prabhu kothā gelā āchārya-ṭhākura

That personality who delivered the treasure of prema-bhakti, who was so intense with compassion — where is such a personality to be found as Śrī Āchārya Ṭhākur (Śrīnivās Āchārya)?

#### 2

    kā̐hā mora svarūp rūpa kā̐hā sanātana
    kā̐hā dāsa raghunātha patita-pāvana

Where are the saviours of the fallen souls? Where is my Svarūp Dāmodar, and where are Rūpa Goswāmī and Sanātan Goswāmī? Where is Raghunāth Dās to be found?

#### 3

    kā̐hā mora bhaṭṭa-juga kā̐hā kavirāja
    eka-kāle kothā gelā gaurā naṭa-rāja

Where are my Raghunāth Bhaṭṭa and Gopāl Bhaṭṭa Goswāmīs? Where am I to find Śrī Krishnadās Kavirāj now? All at once they have gone to join Lord Gaurāṅga, the great dancer.

#### 4

    pāṣāṇe kuṭibo māthā anale paśibo
    gaurāṅga guṇera nidhi kothā gele pābo

To reach such a perfect personality as Lord Chaitanya, I can only break my head against the stone in the anguish of separation.

#### 5

    se-saba saṅgīra saṅge je koilo vilāsa
    se-saṅga nā pāyā kānde narottama dāsa

They have all gone off together in their own Pastimes. Narottam Dās Ṭhākur says: “Unable to obtain their association, I must simply weep.”
