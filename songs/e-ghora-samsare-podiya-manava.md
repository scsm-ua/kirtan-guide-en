# E ghora saṁsare

### by Kālidās

#### 1

    e ghora saṁsāre,    poḍiyā mānava
        na pāya duḥkhera śeṣa
    sādhu-saṅga kori,    hari bhaja jodi,
        tobe anta hoy kleśa

Fallen into this material world of birth and death, there is no end to a person’s unhappiness. Still, if they associate with devotees and worship Lord Hari, then all their sadness and suffering will come to an end.

    biṣoya anale,    jvaliche hṛdaya,
        anale boḍe anal
    aparādha chāḍi’    loy kṛṣṇa-nāma,
        anale paḍaye jola

The heart burns in the fire of sense gratification and the fire burns more and more. Avoiding offences, chant the Holy Names of Lord Krishna, for that will pour water on the fire.

    nitāi chaitanya,    charaṇa-kamale,
        āśroya loilo jei
    kālidās bole    jīvane maraṇe,
        āmāra āśroya sei

Kālidās says, “Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Chaitanya and Lord Nityānanda is my shelter in life and death.”
