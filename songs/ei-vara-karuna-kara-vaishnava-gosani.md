# Vaiṣṇava Vijñāpti

## by Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur

#### 1

    ei-vāra karuṇā kara vaiṣṇava gosāñi patita-pāvana tomā vine keha nāi

O Vaiṣṇava Goswāmī, please be merciful to me this one time. You are the saviour of the fallen; without you there is no one.

#### 2

    kāhāra nikaṭe gele pāpa dūre yāya emana dayāla prabhu kevā kothā pāya

Just by being in your presence, sins go far away. Where can anyone find such kindness?

#### 3

    gaṅgāra paraśa haile paśchāte pāvana darśane pavitra kara ei tomāra guṇa

Merely by the touch of the waters of the sacred Ganges one becomes liberated, even if he is the lowest of mankind; but just by seeing you, the same effect is achieved. Such is your quality.

#### 4

    hari-sthāne aparādhe tāre harināma tomā-sthāne aparādhe nāhika eḍāna

If one commits an offence at the feet of Lord Hari, he can be forgiven if he chants the Holy Name. But if one offends you, there is no salvation for him.

#### 5

    tomāra hṛdaye sadā govinda-viśrāma govinda kahena mama vaiṣṇava parāna

In your heart Govinda is always resting. Śrī Govinda Himself says, “My devotees are My life and soul.”

#### 6

    prati janme kari āśā charaṇera dhuli narottame kara dayā āpanāra vali

I hope that in every birth I will obtain the dust of your lotus feet. Śrī Narottam prays, “Please, Oh Vaiṣṇava Goswāmī, be kind unto me.”
