    ṭhākura vaiṣṇava-gaṇa    kori ei nivedana mo boḍo adhama durāchāra
    dāruṇa-saṁsāra-nidhi  tāhe ḍhūbailo vidhi keśe dhori more kara para

O saintly Vaiṣṇavas, although I am very fallen and misbehaved, I nevertheless place this appeal before you. My destiny has immersed me in this fearsome ocean of repeated birth and death. Please grab me by the hair, and pull me to the opposite shore.

    vidhi boḍo valavān  na śune dharama-jñāna sadāi karama-pāśe bāndhe
    nā dekhi tāraṇa leśa   jata dekhi saba kleśa anātha kātare te̐i kānde

My destiny is very powerful. I am not able to hear the knowledge of spiritual life, and I am always bound by the ropes of *karma*. I cannot see any way to escape my
condition. I see only suffering. Helpless and stricken with grief, I cry.

    kāma krodha lobha moha mada abhimāna saha āpana āpana sthāne ṭāne
    aichāna āmāra mana    phire jena andha jana supatha vipatha nāhi jāne

I am just like a blind man unable to see what path is auspicious or inauspicious. I am helplessly dragged from here to there by lust, anger, greed, bewilderment, madness, and pride.

    na loinu sat mata   asate majilo chita tuyā pāye na korinu āśa
    narottama dāse koy  dekhi śuni lage bhay tarāiyā loho nija pāśa

My mind became immersed in the impermanent satisfaction of the senses, and I could not understand the real goal of life. For this reason I did not aspire to attain Your lotus feet. Narottam Dās says, “Now that I am able to see and hear the Vaiṣṇavas, I have become free from all fear.
