# He deva bhavantaṁ vande

### by Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī

#### 1

        he deva bhavantaṁ vande
    man-mānasa-madhukara marpaya nija-pada-
            paṅkaja-makarande

Oh Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances to You. May you place the bumblebee of my mind in the honey of Your lotus feet.

    yadapi samādhiṣu vidhir api paśyati
            na tava nakhā gramarīchim
    idam ichāmi niśamya tavāchyuta
            tad api kṛpādbhuta vīchim

Although Brahmā in his *samādhi* cannot obtain a glimpse of even a ray of the tips of the nails of Your feet, still Oh Achyuta! Having heard of the waves of Your astonishing mercy, I yearn to see You.

    bhaktir udañchati yad api mādhava
            na tvayi mama tila-mātrī
    parameśvaratā tad api tavādhika-
            durghaṭa-ghaṭana-vidhātrī

Oh Mādhava, although I have not even a sesame seed of devotion for You, Your supreme power can make even the impossible become possible.

#### 4

    ayam avilola tayādya sanātana
            kalitādbhuta-rasa-bhāram
    nivasatu nityam ihāmṛta-nindini
            vindan madhurima-sāram

Oh eternal Lord, may the bumblebee of my mind, finding there the most wonderful sweetness, eternally stay in the honey of Your lotus feet, which rebuke the sweetest nectar.
