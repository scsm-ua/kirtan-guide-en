    nitāi-pada-kamala,  koṭī-chandra-suśītala, je chāyāya jagata juḍāy
    heno nitāi bine bhāi,  rādhā-kṛṣṇa pāite nāi, dṛḍha kori dharo nitāira pāya

The holy lotus feet of Nitāi,
cooling like ten million moons—
In the shade of which
the world gains soothing relief; Without that Nitāi, O brother,
No one can reach Rādhā and Krishna— Clasp His lotus feet with full conviction.

    se sambandha nāhi jāra, vṛthā janma gelo tāra, sei paśu boḍo durāchāra
    nitāi nā bolilo mukhe,  majilo saṁsāra-sukhe, vidyā-kule ki koribe tāra

One who never got His connection, passed his life in vain—
Such an animal is so very wicked;
He whose mouth never uttered ‘Nitāi,’ merged in mundane pleasures—
How can his aristocratic lineage save him?

    ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā, asatyere satya kori māni
    nitāiyer karuṇā habe, vraje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe, dharo nitāiyer charaṇ du’ khāni

Maddened with pride,
forgetting the lotus feet of Nitāi— I embrace untruth as truth;
But when Nitāi gives His Grace
you’ll reach Rādhā and Krishna in Vraja— O embrace the lotus feet of Nitāi!

#### 4

    nitāiyer charaṇa satya, tā̐hāra sevaka nitya, nitāi-pada sadā kara āśa
    narottama boḍo duḥkhī, nitāi more kara sukhī rākho rāṅgā-charaṇera pāśa

The lotus feet of Nitāi are truth,
His servitors are eternal— Ever aspire for the shelter of His feet;
Narottam is very sad— O Nitāi make me happy— Please keep me at Your lovely lotus feet!
