# After parikramā

    nagara bhramiyā āmāra gaura elo ghore
    gaura elo ghore āmāra nitāi elo ghore
    dhūlā jhāri śacīmātā gaura kole kore
    ānandete bhakta-goṇe hari hari bole

“After *parikramā* of the town, Gaurāṅga returns to His house, and Nitāi also comes to the house. Dusting off His body, Śachī Mātā takes Gaurāṅga upon her lap. Out of great spiritual joy all the devotees are chanting ‘Hari Hari Bol!’”
