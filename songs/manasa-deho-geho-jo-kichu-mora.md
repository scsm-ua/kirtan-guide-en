    mānasa, deho, geho, jo kichū mora
    arpilu̐ tuyā pade, nanda-kiśora!

Mind, body, and family, whatever may be mine, I have surrendered at Your lotus feet, O youthful son of Nanda!

#### 2

    sampade vipade, jīvane-maraṇe dāy mama gelā, tuyā o-pada varaṇe

In good fortune or in bad, in life or at death, all my difficulties have disappeared by choosing those feet of Yours as my only shelter.

    mārobi rākhobi—jo ichā tohārā nitya-dāsa prati tuyā adhikārā

Slay me or protect me as You wish, for You are the master of Your eternal servant.

    janmāobi moye ichā jadi tora bhakta-gṛhe jani janma hau mora

If it is Your will that I be born again, then may it be in the home of Your devotee.

    kīṭa-janma hau yathā tuyā dāsa
    bahir-mukha brahma-janme nāhi āśa

May I be born again even as a worm, as long as I may remain Your devotee. I have no desire to be born as a Brahmā averse to You.

    bhukti-mukti-spṛhā bihīna je bhakta labhaite tā̐ka saṅga anurakta

I yearn for the company of the devotee completely devoid of all desire for worldly enjoyment or liberation.

    janaka, jananī, doyita, tanoy prabhu, guru, pati—tuhu̐ sarva-moy

Father, mother, lover, son, Lord, preceptor, and
husband—You are everything to me.

    bhakativinoda kohe, śuno kāna! rādhā-nātha! tuhu̐ hāmāra parāṇa

Bhakti Vinod says, “O Krishna, please hear me! Oh Lord of Rādhā, You are my life and soul!”
