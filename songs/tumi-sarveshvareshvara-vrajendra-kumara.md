# Tumi sarveśvareśvara

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    tumi sarveśvareśvara, vrajendra-kumāra!
    tomāra ichāya viśve sṛjana saṁhāra

O youthful son of the King of Vraja, You are the Lord of all lords. According to Your will, creation and destruction take place in the universe.

#### 2

    tava ichā-mato brahmā korena sṛjana
    tava ichā-mato viṣṇu korena pālana

According to Your desire Lord Brahmā creates and according to Your desire Lord Viṣṇu maintains.

#### 3

    tava ichā-mate śiva korena saṁhāra
    tava ichā-mate māyā sṛje kārāgāra

According to Your will Lord Śiva destroys, according to Your will Māyā constructs the prison house of this world.

#### 4

    tava ichā-mate jīver janama-maraṇa
    samṛddhi-nipāta duḥkha sukha-saṅghaṭana

According to Your will the living beings take birth and die, and according to Your will they meet with prosperity and ruin, happiness and sorrow.

#### 5

    miche māyā-baddha jīva āśā-pāśe phire
    tava ichā vinā kichu korite nā pāre

The tiny soul bound up by Māyā vainly struggles in the fetters of worldly desire. Without Your sanction the soul is unable to do anything.

#### 6

    tumi to’ rakṣaka āro pālaka āmāra
    tomāra charaṇa vinā āśā nāhi āra

You are my only protector and maintainer. Except for Your lotus feet there is no other hope for me.

#### 7

    nija-bala-cheṣṭa-prati bharasā chāḍiyā
    tomāra ichāya āchi nirbhara koriyā

No longer confident of my own strength and endeavour, I have become solely dependent on Your will.

#### 8

    bhakativinoda ati dīna akiñchana
    tomāra ichāya tā’ra jīvana maraṇa

Bhakti Vinod is most poor, and his pride has been leveled. Now in accordance with Your will he lives and dies.
