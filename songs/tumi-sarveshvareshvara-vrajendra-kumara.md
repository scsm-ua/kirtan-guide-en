According to Your desire Lord Brahmā creates and according to Your desire Lord Viṣṇu maintains.

According to Your will Lord Śiva destroys, according to Your will Māyā constructs the prison house of this world.

According to Your will the living beings take birth and die, and according to Your will they meet with prosperity and ruin, happiness and sorrow.

No longer confident of my own strength and endeavour, I have become solely dependent on Your will.

    tomāra ichāya tā’ra jīvana maraṇa

Bhakti Vinod is most poor, and his pride has been leveled. Now in accordance with Your will he lives and dies.
