# Srila Bhakti Nirmal Acharya Maharaj

    pūjya śrī-guru-varga-vandita
        mahā-bhāvānvitāyāḥ sadā
    paurvā paryya paramparā prachalita
        prājya pramūrttā kṛteḥ
    bhakte nirmala-nirjharasya nibhṛtaṁ
        saṁrakṣakaṁ sādaraṁ
    vande śrī-gurudevam ānata-śirā
        āchāryya-varyyaṁ nijam 

"I bow my head in eternal obeisance to my Gurudev, the best of Acharyas, Shrila Bhakti Nirmal Acharya Maharaj. He is the ever vigilant, stalwart guardian of the current of pure devotion whose highest form flows from our most worshippable Shri Rupanuga Guru-varga in their exclusive dedication to Mahabhava, Shrimati Radharani."

    prerakaṁ prāchya-pāścātya-śiṣyāṇāṁ
        bhakti-vartmani
    bhakti-nirmalam-ācārya-svāminaṁ
        praṇamāmy aham 

I offer my respectful obeisances to Swami Bhakti Nirmal Acharya, who is energetically inspiring all of the Eastern and Western disciples on the path of pure devotion.
