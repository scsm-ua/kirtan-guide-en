# Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

## Song 8b

### by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur

#### 1

    yoga-pīṭhopari-sthita,    aṣṭa-sakhī-subeṣṭita,
        vṛndāraṇye kadamba-kānane
    rādhā-saha vaṁśī-dhārī, biśva-jana-chitta-hārī,
        prāṇa mora tā̐hāra charaṇe

At the yoga-pīṭha, surrounded by the aṣṭa-sakhīs, in Vṛndāvan Forest, in a grove of kadamba trees, by the side of Śrī Rādhā, holding His flute, Śrī Krishna enchants all souls within the universe. I fall at His feet and surrender my life to Him.

#### 2

    sakhī-ājñāmata kori do̐hāra sevana
    pālya-dāsī sadā bhāvi do̐hāra charaṇa

Following the orders of a sakhī, I engage in service to the holy pair, Śrī Rādhā and Krishna, always considering myself a dependent maidservant at Their lotus feet.

#### 3

    kobhu kṛpā kori,    mama hasta dhori’,
        madhura vachana bole
    tāmbula loiyā,    khāya dui jone,
        mālā loya kutūhole

Sometimes being kind, They take me by the hand and speak sweet words to me out of affection. Taking the betel nuts I have prepared, the two of Them eat and accept a garland from me with great delight.

#### 4

    adarśana hoya kokhona ki chole
    nā dekhiyā do̐he hiyā mora jvole

Again, They disappear from my vision by some trick. Not seeing Rādhā and Krishna, my heart burns in agony.

#### 5

    jekhāne sekhāne,    thākuka du’ jane,
        āmi to charaṇa-dāsī
    milane ānanda,    virahe jātanā,
        sakala sammāna vāsi

Here or there, wherever They stay, I am the maidservant of Their lotus feet. Through the happiness of union and the agony of separation, I am Their maidservant.

#### 6

    rādhā-kṛṣṇa prāṇa mor jīvane maraṇe
    more rākhi’ māri’ sukhe thākuka du’ jone

Rādhā and Krishna are my life and soul in life and in death; whether They protect me or take my life—may they always be happy.

#### 7

    bhakativinoda,    āna nāhi jāne,
        poḍi’ nija-sakhī-pāy
    rādhikāra goṇe    thākiyā satata,
        jugala-charaṇa chāy

Bhakti Vinod knows nothing else. Falling at the feet of the sakhī, Bhakti Vinod stays among the intimate confidants of Śrī Rādhā. The lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā and Krishna is Bhakti Vinod’s eternal desire.

Footnote to Song 8b: *Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāja advised not to sing this song because it’s “too high.”*
